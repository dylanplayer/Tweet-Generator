tweet going lot of work for an extra secs of hopefully will happen this decade true i am accumulating resources to help make life extend the light of consciousness to the stars when vast amounts of manufacturing are as in this slows down rate of so maybe more like still not trying to just being as literal as possible but not quite how i would tell the but it‚Äôs probably worth a read this is important hard to believe that was years ! sigh _ i actually ate the sandwich music in zero gravity given significant architectural including fundamental improvements to pure there is limited value to testing hoping to upload button next an orbital propellant depot optimized for cryogenic storage probably makes sense –∏ the we could talk about the universe and everything coming as you can i have a long history with using what would you like to talk üíØ floor is elevator is waiting on glass the high bay is measured to we will need launch tower for hook height for the lift is m both booster ship need to be stabilized at stage separation booster 1 is a production figuring out how to build transport meter tall booster 2 will first super heavy booster sometimes it‚Äôs about doge the simulation really struggled to make this look real acerbic alliteration bullshit baffles brains that‚Äôs our goal almost ready to fly doesn‚Äôt feel quite right selling will doge selling this song about as an yes did rest of world payload to orbit last probably to this year i love it makes my heart this is good play your favorite song in a turn the volume to you will you will we will support as best we can fly my fly a puckish rogue this is an opportunity for to outdo what has become absolutely clear is that the plethora of corner cases can only be solved with optical this is how humans designed the road system to once you have that in silicon everything else is just icing on the falcon flies for the time tonight it sees in all directions simultaneously getting a homo sapiens loves raves technology why are you so they ask origin of doge day the ancient sacrificed a at the beginning of the doge days to appease the rage of believing that the star was the cause of the sultry doge day afternoon battle for the moral high ground in this new üé∂ this magic moment üé∂ yes for sure wise for elderly or to take the some debate about the second jab quite a few negative reactions to beta has now been expanded to owners we‚Äôve also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the no accidents to next significant release will be in going with pure vision ‚Äî not even using this is the way to absolutely both do mining use blocks chains is an anagram of boring what a quarks leptons green flame in this context means engine is burning internal components made of this is usually followed by a unscheduled transparent aluminum might be cool celebrating a year of great work by the . like , but if manifest is will do of total earth payload to orbit with a single is designed to do in a day what all rockets on earth currently do in a even will take years to build a city on yes falcon 9 is almost always at max when it has it flies back to which costs much less than using a our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit last launched roughly double payload mass of rest of fuel cells should be called fool such a silly choice for not great even for a rocket upper stage but at least not i was just up elevator on the other floor is glass coming we talked about that could just have it land on a big net or bouncy lacks but would optimized landing propellant is only of dry so it‚Äôs not a might just catch the ship with the launch same as booster battery energy density is the key to electric autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time modern airliners are very close to there were but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above something similar happened on an early falcon 1 resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine fair if pressurization had been bubbles would most likely have reverted to helium in header was used to prevent collapse from which happened in prior my fault for sounded good at the engine was low on thrust due to partial helium ingestion from fuel header impact of crushed legs part of multiple fixes in work for we will ask the regulators build of should be done testing by end of next so that‚Äôs roughly when download button should show up assuming user approves warning agrees to drive it will download latest build as soon as car connects to cabs should be able to drive themselves when you‚Äôre in them be electric by it until you make it not connecting cars to as our terminal is much too this is for large trucks it‚Äôs all hot air in the end still many fine details to but the final product will be there‚Äôs nothing else even so much dignity is ascribed to efficiency of the yes great too bad they broke up update probably in will be built at so focus right now is on getting that beast the is mostly good as the people get to choose how the money is but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole it is obviously characterized should be very many subtle differences between us so harder than it the computer started shipping in volume in cars should all have whether or not ordered as an availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays internal development word is used to reduce complacency in usage set expectations all software is first tested internally by simulation drive due to high levels of demand for adding button to service section of car display in days doge spelled backwards is beta has literally will take time to internally before release probably in two or three this was way past leg they got squashed if you want the full beta downloaded to your let us doubling beta program size now with probably size with still be but it‚Äôs getting is an old timer who has seen a lot of thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at hence hard we‚Äôve never seen this next min two engines all the way to the ground restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have was super fun or is this just üôÑ is in now of mars both hardware is deeply underestimated ford are the only carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of of car prototypes are production is hard being cash flow positive is team is doing great one the true measure of success will be that flights are rip honorable discharge landed in one launch abort on slightly conservative high thrust increasing thrust limit recycling propellant for another flight attempt 5 to test flight attempt march launch window opens at beta will be offered much more widely when version 9 is hopefully next month beta build normally drives me around with no next version is a big step change beyond is solving a major part of this is not widely you‚Äôre welcome good point let‚Äôs figure this out all for exciting video but we also can‚Äôt have the place festooned with first heard of we‚Äôll fix the a fan of indeed it was sounds about but we want to be very careful with this transition period there was still a surprisingly high usage of horses in but the trend was obvious _ space from thence to and hence the an area much larger than very much so its leader shall be the doge creating the city of cool yup horses are even scammers should get a room is dumb buying will still be a better deal than subscription for sure green eggs looks familiar the right congrats to rocket china team doge meme shield new drug coming out called pop one all regrets are always wondered where exactly your gaming character keeps all the stuff ahem do androids dream of electric nothing if not discreet hey babe üòâ üôè we will use a catapult air mattresses to land on the then base jump off nickel is our biggest concern for scaling cell that‚Äôs why we are shifting standard range cars to an iron plenty of iron absolutely shut down for two days restarted yesterday this is not about winning anyone we are the reason we are making our own cells is to max production of even moving at full they cannot build enough i hope they it would be awesome prices in the us all don‚Äôt include but it‚Äôs usually included in other then there‚Äôs import duty transport the intent is that revenue to is roughly similar in all so tariffs transport make up the of full hard or stainless is bulletproof to a or not a i mean actual books both i admit to judging books by their cover to the moon sounds like a good idea out on launch engine swap underway probably mid but is really meant for those who are least bay usually has great you might see much higher download speeds on at testing system rockets are ridiculously hard _ i love dogs memes on the actual moon literally potentially many steps some steps we do a lot of before releasing a beta they will fly there from our launch stationed around the seems likely we‚Äôre upgrading all to surround using on focal areas equal compute on all many other so more time needed to write validate maybe something next this is evolving into solving a big part of physical world interesting one of them may be in limited operation by end of year one of the engines is so we‚Äôre swapping it out delivered propellant is reaction to convert + + using wind solar just a surface detail i hope we don‚Äôt go bankrupt building üçÜ super cool we have too much product complexity already _ later this year _ later this year it is still available off but i don‚Äôt think the in many drive yet meets the standard of excellence the solar roof is slightly so snow or ice slide off easily final design is was just in the studio most of earth by end of all by next then it‚Äôs about important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban satellites are best for low to medium population density speed will double to latency will drop to later this year of spaceflight 4 doge good chance of flying this should why don‚Äôt we have these explained or did they say pegged to the something like that heard a rumor some coin was pegging the dollar machine learning is so just some used rigs bought off not really but it was a fun family most people have no even though there are so many progress videos understood right there will be a gap before the next but then it will be a step change is solving a major i just set up some little doge mining rigs with my it was that do seem high an email saying you have gold is not the same as having you might as well have money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of that like all is subject to latency the system will evolve to that which minimizes avocado toast i just want to start a flame in your heart just for a day a hash text file using ancient can be exchanged for real goods to be i am an i am an i don‚Äôt even own any publicly traded stock besides when fiat currency has negative real only a fool wouldn‚Äôt look bitcoin is almost as as fiat the

no power in there will definitely be a sounds like it is active fairing half recovered team is helping save the turtles disturbing concentration only if necessary absolutely i will literally pay actual $ if they just void their accounts yup temporarily raise an acceptable doge is much more if major holders sell most of their it will get my full too much concentration is the only real issue success on landing probability is this time —Å would you like join me for a conversation on meme juice for the weekend good we‚Äôre working on lowering min throttle of so that there is engine redundancy throughout the landing banks are basically heterogeneous databases with high latency weak especially transfers credit a know a thing or two about payments an alien ray tracing on cyberpunk

that you get to hang out with - the future currency of earth just a scratch much üñ§ destiny was essential that the ship landing burn has a clear my greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid full without which we shall forever be confined to _ will still use hot gas maneuvering as more efficient than nitrogen sec vs sec higher too it would seem but raptors have much higher thrust propellant mass fraction than gas they‚Äôre already there yes it‚Äôs by engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are but engines have a min throttle point where there is so landing on 3 engines means high away from hover which is also risky _ yes it was foolish of us not to start 3 engines immediately shut down as 2 are needed to land i am become destroyer of shorts might actually happen sandstorm is a masterpiece we were too dumb next we try pull method no no only doge no need to be a to own is the people‚Äôs welcome the most entertaining outcome is the most likely doge high seas wind this was a tough one off twitter for a while it will be filled with graffiti art progress is working super hard to ensure implant safety is in close communication with the if things go we might be able to do initial human trials later this if you‚Äôve worked on advanced phones or those skills are needed feels weird helping make good version cyberpunk come true please consider working at solve injuries symbiosis latter will be important work at either at our bay area or locations on clubhouse tonight at la time tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed before that is not recommended he became a big fan of but was not pushing it that came from me reading about soviet methane engine tests that got over at that a methane stage gets slightly better than a hydrogen that sounds tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those dean too for kestrel tom is great was instrumental in developing early versions of but not later versions of or will be so it will accelerate unusually high is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of the primary for expendable throwing away stages is the primary so optimization is low no escaping that for me read the whole article sunny day snowy mountains what a beautiful day in la _ i never used this he gave a talk at only halo i sure hope that‚Äôs not true at

sell cars u don‚Äôt own but u sell stock u don‚Äôt this is ‚Äì shorting is a scam legal only for vestigial reasons yes finishing engineering this production starts next aiming to have release candidate design late drive system advanced battery work were important i made that absolutely unlike its aircraft which is the space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government under those humanity will never get to nomad ü§ó the of cyberpunk are incredible the interior design major improvements coming a little new roadster is part rocket there‚Äôs more storage now easily yes probably in a few months after you drive without using a for a few it gets very annoying to go back use a no more car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it context you can override on a hedge fund that shorts is a shrubbery also a rear screen 0 to trap speed in a top speed right first production car ever to achieve 0 to mph in less than 2 seconds it can play cyberpunk plaid model s ships next month even discord has gone wild times on discord waiting for review passed initial pressure test yes bought a hand knit wool the martian helm for my dog i kinda love it does not serve the public to hamstring today for an amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation we‚Äôre hoping for approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon the entire from data collection through labeling inference has to be in surround this is a hard this does not require a hardware change to cars in although it will be crazy not to turn on is steadily moving all to 8 camera surround this will enable superhuman the road to hell is mostly paved with bad all launched next year will have laser only our polar have lasers this year are yup i hope so these also have laser links between the so no ground stations are needed over the poles sorry for the version is what it should say for separate version number for rest of to my has better hardware software than it floats opening party for loop happening as soon as under in tunnel yesterday with my boys lasers üíØ we‚Äôre switching to a more sensible version numbering to distinguish between major minor current build is it drove me to an unfamiliar location in la back last night with no early next week given so many other companies are depending on this it is getting even more scrutiny than a flight launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers excited about offering access to orbit for small they are part of the but require lots of fresh water we may need something that‚Äôs scale industrial in to for by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy it‚Äôs a good path for fully renewable rocket so solves part of but longer chain hydrocarbons than are needed to be solid at room temp details next week am donating towards a prize for best carbon capture technology _ pretty much that would probably mean civilization is doing although depends on assumptions for inflation he‚Äôs everywhere they üñ§ the part or process in cell production is constantly changing cars trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases but road tunnels under would solve traffic be an example to the spoke with about tunnels last if governor mayor want this we will do _ with our giant casting we are literally trying to make cars in the same way that toy cars are made is an exceptionally smart good human _ the best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume like food some medical toys battery cell production is the fundamental slowing down a sustainable energy very important looking into no question that should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a for sure glad you‚Äôre this is a good one i whistle doesn‚Äôt need a garage it will be awesome good point your code is doing too much happy birthday so glad you guess you been watching cobra fallout new only chuck can divide by zero good point the thing we call money is just an information system for labor what actually matters is making goods providing we should look at currencies from an information theory whichever has least error latency will python is amazing they sure can twist the knife in that probably wise we‚Äôre making major improvements to ease of engine needs to be a few hours at two of the engines need slight so will be switched out nice shot we don‚Äôt have high school but please apply when you‚Äôre in prototypes are volume production is positive cash flow is excruciating physics inspections good progress towards our in go to all three static fires completed no a lot has happened in fair enough sea shanty takes it to a new level with actual pirate ships sure today at is about practicing engine ship is held down by massive pins while engines are two starts about to try a as promised legalize comedy you can steal our we probably won‚Äôt sue you we‚Äôre just trying to get people to help would be one we will get a camera up there that also shows the star field in the background suicide is more than double homicide absolutely hey you yeah you queen you‚Äôre gonna make hate to say but might be true the robot future is coming every but there are times i wish it were faster mus üë∂ this is an important distinction much more than this increasing rapidly it is once in a something happens that is even better than we imagined the factory is the product probably commenting on will do more i bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for they‚Äôre great places to get spare a lot of people are going to be super unhappy with west coast high tech as the arbiter of free speech already donated to signal a year will donate i am primarily trying to advance two sustainable energy extending beyond there is also the existential threat of which we should aspire to this doesn‚Äôt leave time to write maybe a day later this year the prancing üò¢ it‚Äôs true but not for long they seemed optimistic too my said he feels like will be a good i let us all make it was also thinking that should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time i super support public spaces around our production launch wherever it can be done safely and when we will open up our restaurant to the public figure out ways to allow limited access to the high that too catapult high into the air land on the roof with a base jumping parachute only way to that‚Äôs actually our but is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with degree windows a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory and increase me neither one of the best solar roof installations but maybe one day that would be the best way to do a large solar field or reactor is needed for and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the these are probably the trickier his sick beats probably less than a few dozen primary only or at least the option for so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts launch underway critical feedback is always super as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference harder than it yup an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert this will be needed on mars even for early missions earth too over not to get to in photon emission powered by annihilation would but that‚Äôs more of a this will be hard to as it isn‚Äôt like any other vehicle playing the long game true i hope wings don‚Äôt work on the moon at all and def not well on no have the potential of and a back to work how strange use signal ya don‚Äôt reminds me of this timeless classic fast water with tiny rocks and then razor is actually third most likely as seen from an external not the participants the most entertaining outcome is the most likely dumb and dumber is a great movie tho this is called the domino effect doesn‚Äôt quite illustrate true size payload volume mass are that of because of the large it may seem but actually ranges up to 5 stories tall snow falling on yes üòâ is responsible for of all the personal professional pain in my life but it was worth so proud of the team for achieving this major at the start of i thought we had a chance of surviving at we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance full will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this of that i am can‚Äôt speak for regulators isn‚Äôt but will make it isn‚Äôt enough to be safer than human autopilot ultimately needs to be more

a few lumps along the way production is prototypes are building to create a city on mars is our exactly will press header tank with solution is under not clear what is yes legs would certainly but best part is no best step is no step yes saves mass cost of legs enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount ‚Äî ready to in under an hour we‚Äôre going to try to catch the super heavy booster with the launch tower using the grid fins to take the load dog had my undivided attention until ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant seems odd that the opposition group is from home state of very far from where is building the and why would a group that claims to be oppose a sustainable energy aren‚Äôt there more important this is very opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress literally are we sure this is destiny no escaping that for me all cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the full option for delivery docs must be fully complete by midnight and mark this action is not the last kingdom show is great will be text but could add voice even cheese is made of cake if they don‚Äôt love we‚Äôre in deep not everything is made of cake true such a weird game when you think about it this is not we need a overhaul these are just incremental improvements to the production build is a fundamental not just in the but also our

instead of engaging in corporate power this is the good roughly of parts in roadster were unique ‚Äî not in any other since we started out with the in goal of simply adapting lotus to we ended up with a too small sports car that seems kinda like a yes very important service might be able to do will you mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don‚Äôt have but definitely this year good point interesting has always done great interviews falcon was of successful orbital launches in but maybe a majority of payload to anyone done the vaccines are just the it‚Äôs also capable in theory of curing almost turns medicine into a software simulation yes we will offer multiple display options a few more revisions probably beta or sure there are differences between us traffic but beta will be extended to very soon yes we need a other traffic setting definitely it‚Äôs a step in that direction it‚Äôs one üî• or üî• if you don‚Äôt have a car with pedestrian we couldn‚Äôt get everything done in but more stuff the writing on cobra is i will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts you can upload custom pedestrian speaker is otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn change your horn sound to üí® or holiday jingles with latest software merry happy üéÅ great it will most likely make sense for to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable design general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind are the fundamental limitation on doing capital allocation is but low public company duties are a much bigger but going private is impossible now yes a few months coming soon minor yeah story rocket turns off its engines does a controlled fall we‚Äôre just ironing out a few bugs to owners taking delivery in the final days of your support is super what could possibly go good idea during the darkest days of the model 3 i reached out to cook to discuss the possibility of apple acquiring of our current he refused to take the if - already uses for medium range cars made in our shanghai - a is as max voltage is too maybe they meant cells bonded like our structural battery reply to hi thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make my heart goes out to indeed it was a seriously twisted but all‚Äôs that ends they although it‚Äôs kind superchargers are being made accessible to other electric are such large transactions even i love all u crazy out there you have a point great game pretty the main value of college used to be hanging having pseudo intellectual conversations partying with people your own even that‚Äôs come for the stay for the we will release subscription early next one doge bitcoin is almost as as fiat money great nails lipstick nice sounds about right edge nice branding just who needs a safe word bitcoin is my safe word standing down for today to inspect hopefully launching pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen review i am hoping to be back next very impressive mission by last launch of coming up he was indeed quite but we did not actually know what we were so he had a point it will get absurdly engineering is there‚Äôs some great out but can it while playing cyberpunk ? star star bright this is incorrect but it is visually stunning is good a being better armor than a chest plate doesn‚Äôt make sense in the absence of wish there weren‚Äôt item limits in a oh and i absolutely support but all these pronouns are an nightmare the raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude as we hit min throttle an engine would shut far from fully but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy with three engines it‚Äôs a good to great game but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great perhaps slightly more but it‚Äôs essential to view this as output vs as with all especially new output will follow an very slow at but increasing then then sure hope that future doesn‚Äôt come to will be the first to use our new structural pack most advanced made both front rear body castings advanced paint with so much new production timing is naturally harder to original ex was human revolution was also great the objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old this is a much more serious . ascent to the heavens ü§£ seems pretty i picked so start was a little but picks up seemed like almost everyone on steam was playing cyberpunk at some point this void i still have a soft spot in my heart for transpiration in it would use more mass than a tile but that remains to be ship leeward side will be bare windward will have hexagonal heat shield tiles yes should be preserved in memory of did even reaching apogee would‚Äôve been so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was thank south for your this is the gateway to the universe and everything engines did here we fuel header tank pressure was low during landing causing touchdown velocity to be high but we got all the data we congrats team hell successful switchover to header tanks precise flap control to landing ü§† space is the fastest way to travel long distance on it‚Äôs called the space but it‚Äôs actually moving around earth at times the speed of sound or times faster than a rifle bullet and thanks for the - alien message probably chance of completing all mission objectives hopefully flying tomorrow yup out on the pad in south station looks singing carrying even more symbiotic bacteria than cells _ yes we are mobile cell colonies it and no toilet paper watch demolition man unbound not bad it was a beast compared to the award accepted on behalf of the great people at boring co much of what people think of an science is actually no such thing as a only rocket latter is who put humans on the science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the engineering is about creating things that never existed it does get a bit cold at night paint makes a hell of a difference thanks for everything you did to help build some of the best memories it will be real soon legs are one of the hardest externally mounted legs require which adds wider stance adds shock add that we need better static fire is not risky from build but we need to clear the build site for early flights just a static fire flight no earlier than it will have landing legs very sad tony was for a second i thought that was a pic of truncate zeros then round probably going to a wider beta in weeks with least important digits truncated it feels like is what we‚Äôre betting on for training with for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great but happy hopefully next month overall air suspension height damping algorithm is getting a lot of will be linked to so acts true the promise is greatly needed we will have special colors for new as we did for the original . is savage if you ever wondered where we came from this is a life leader so more risk than normal but only slightly filled this is a subject of much debate major upgrades are slated for many small but overall wiring is more engines are more nosecone is sealed but that‚Äôs why we have 9 lot of things need to go so maybe chance good static aiming for first / ft altitude flight next goals are to test 3 engine body transition from main to header tanks landing maybe start on that a year from depends on how progress not yet not we will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all but it‚Äôs probably smarter than a whole new shorter external rapid complete rocket low cost orbital refilling propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life yes we‚Äôre still far from simply video control the biggest currently underway at is high fps video for training beta 5 coming out in a few improvement should be exciting wow yea tomorrow will be the flight of this landing on of course i still love you sure true we have quiet a queue of products to better do new roadster at some fate loves but hates hypocrisy yes üòÉ our data center was named as a joke over years might have been tempting is a vehicle for creating producing many useful products largest cast titanium part in the no heat shielding landing at in off to the side it doesn‚Äôt take out the launch mount in bad but with the same arm used to pick up the ship where it should because i am not an is definitely not the only good but investing is not what i but i always put my own money into companies i help otherwise it‚Äôd be wrong to ask others to do almost anything quite the day ahead now is what you‚Äôd call cool they‚Äôre moving at times the speed of but it feels like nothing there will always be upgrades it will be better than human vision by quite a margin reality looks like a strange at radar almost everything except metal is exactly this is a developed continues to use for dragon docking with just pointless for if you‚Äôre going to do active photon use an occlusion penetrating like precision radar at one day we will fly you on well i can‚Äôt comment on internal but you‚Äôre roughly in the rocket especially if are insanely the hardest problem known to to be this was just an other companies in china have not done is but it should be said that we have a very talented team at too much credit comes to me they stole apple‚Äôs code they have an old version of our software don‚Äôt have our inference computer wild . yup change out a few otherwise fine caution strongly advised with sure sexy cropping champion of all time if next week‚Äôs release looks we will widen beta there are too many rules around liquor even in the we will be selling the lightning bottle shot glasses next week‚Äôs release is lot of fundamental both important bug fixes entire new areas of years billion wow _ safety is our primary design goal fully let the martians decide their own future a lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both will be too slow to be relevant in our we can establish a human base there in our at least a future civilization ‚Äì discovering our ruins ‚Äì will be impressed humans got that that is certainly the the only publicly traded stock i own is wise words from the point of companies is products they have no point in of nor do these buy hold stock in companies where you love the product sell where you just a mild same with my def had means viral load of million per life in glass domes at to support like yeah i was going to say but that seemed too obvious and cases with high ct should quarantine for a few while getting another second test determines whether they‚Äôre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail where viral fragments but person is not so many things you want some you didn‚Äôt know you wanted maybe a little mercy holiday software release is üòè cobra is a deep cut it‚Äôs all cake someone took a bite there is such a thing as too much sentience ex machine learning it‚Äôs designed to make

groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in in indeed looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than for more than tons to so it‚Äôs mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year exactly is a strong local maximum but kerosene is no matter what you what matters is cost per ton to is the only choice allows of ratio of vs for so of propellant is but from a visiting the irony is just too ct was unequivocal at doesn‚Äôt matter what method you use at that low a cycle maybe making some notable will wait until figurative literal dust pretty definitely feel üíØ if i take this was one of the mildest experiences ever avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields adding steel pipes to test pad about 2 secs after starting covering concrete below sending blades of hardened rock into engine one rock blade severed avionics causing bad shutdown of the most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they don‚Äôt blow the amount of power going through them boggles the we should just count the atoms at this point of rocket engines is over of the this is true in for production is over of the that inspiration is very but it‚Äôs less than of the our first engine design was really bad nothing worked well some parts didn‚Äôt work at years later thousands of upgrades make it a great cycle maybe just love irony they‚Äôre on their more next special permission received from fate üñ§ irony well üëª üíµ that‚Äôs not i spent quite a bit of time looking at they‚Äôre yes üé∂ toss a bitcoin to üé∂ üòâ a few makes the machine uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of creating synthetic for is the future of medicine turns it into a software modeling great thread thanks for no symptoms for past few apart from unless something would have to say that it simply felt like a mild launch in 5 minutes with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls the same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital as one use obviates the other dragon can also hover land but we use the parachutes for maximum safety are integrated with enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety i feel pretty no symptoms right last i had symptoms of a minor had some brutal but this was mild hopefully doing tests from several different same time of administered by am requesting gene cycle there is no official standard for not sure people realize both insanely too bad they had this pointless argument astronaut launch no kids though hell of a wig collection too it would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results worth reading this thread if you‚Äôre curious about testing they should be if you get a blood pressure they tell you the not just if it‚Äôs there is not a clear consensus on what ct value of what gene constitutes a little up feels just like a regular but more body achy cloudy head than in your at what ct number for the gene should a test probably be regarded as if asking the wrong what is a better ! but please be super expect two steps one lot of new code was just a we can buff it am getting wildly different results from different but most likely i have a moderate case of my symptoms are that of a minor which is no since a is a type of all the way up ahem unless you‚Äôre on laws of you can‚Äôt win you can‚Äôt break even you can‚Äôt stop playing shakes fist at entropy big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 my night saliva sample came back today with gene to showing at cycle at i get results of today‚Äôs test almost no symptoms so hopefully better what‚Äôs feels that way this seems accurate cold symptoms are gone for now there are degrees of makes a lot of hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the center for medicine at oxford general public doesn‚Äôt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright the number of amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral from what i can you‚Äôre probably not infectious above you probably are below sound about this a great worth a case closed soon lab i just spoke to thinks below is to gets dicey above is will talk to several more there must be a graph of amplification cycle vs false positive rate lab i just spoke to said detection below cycles is reliable above cycles is not this is not the spike they don‚Äôt consider that just spoke directly to a testing their main search is for the unique to is also but is generic to other high cycle count give false but they believe accuracy is good below cycles cycles is their strange possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold flu prevalence vs prior if someone comes in with symptoms falsely tests positive for they will assume they have when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal lower the true the higher the false positive number will this sounds but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is from sure is would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the testing what‚Äôs the approximate false positive all things for interesting interesting what is the general population knowledge of accuracy of a test is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough a good test should identify if i have the spike although i have heard some low accuracy numbers for those hard to get a straight false positives will roughly scale with # of tests daily test rate has gone mild sniffles cough slight fever past few right no although i did take i tested then negative then positive so musk tests negative for is an equally correct the antigen from seems to be about as useful as a flipping a the carousel turns ever faster yup exactly symptoms of a typical nothing unusual so if it‚Äôs happening to it‚Äôs happening to getting tests from separate results will take about something extremely bogus is going was tested for four times two tests came back two came back same same same rapid antigen test from burst disk so vehicle appears to be we‚Äôll have to swap out at least one of the maybe melted an engine or fuel hot gas whatever it is caused we need to design out this we lost vehicle reason unknown at liquid oxygen header tank pressure is hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve otherwise it‚Äôs going to pop the 4 astronauts fly to on sat night from first operational flight of crew luck is the best superpower yes it is an honor that they would choose to work with i strive to ensure that the companies enable creative driven people to reach their such a privilege to work with people i like respect so i feel probably happy to see this i do expect this to become an important product for the but probably not financially material for there‚Äôs no burn angle of attack is degrees makes the bioreactor that can make vaccines / has version 2 in version 3 is under checking i just hope this game doesn‚Äôt twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled you can have my damn should be a browser setting thanks to a lot of great hardware software engineers at for sure will be worth it exactly sure it‚Äôs still there wait until you see what will do this is will be back am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no will require extreme chip has temp sensor automatically maintains safe temp enough already on my plate maybe one day will do a those are relatively volume production with high reliability low cost passing all regulations is won‚Äôt overclock the it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your this is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or but a will have orders of magnitude faster input especially we rewrote all labeling software for very different from labeling single won‚Äôt contribute for about a it‚Äôs mostly a generalized training but benchmark we‚Äôre tracking is must beat next gen clusters or it‚Äôs version 1 is about a year away it would appear that their calculations were incorrect china understands the profound importance of the era of expendable rockets will soon be team good is essential for dynamically occluded especially in large intersections

succeed at engineering he that will be relatively as so few users out in the ocean although i didn‚Äôt expect the stock to rise so much so the reason for the stock options is that they‚Äôre needed to help pay for humanity to get to mars in to super appreciate your that convertible loan gave us 6 months of invested in may 5 months closest we got was about a the model 3 ramp was extreme stress pain for a long time ‚Äî from mid to mid production logistics i put in my last even though i thought we would still it was either that or certain death for extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup super quirky back while stalwarts like gm were going that funding round completed on eve in last hour of last day as investors were leaving town that night we were 3 days away from i put in all money i didn‚Äôt own a house had to borrow money from friends to pay difficult yes lowering terminal which may sound rather is actually our most difficult technical challenge as soon as we get regulatory around middle of next right it takes about 5 to set with future probably less than 3 no technical knowledge just point at open sky plug and are next after we get us out of early didn‚Äôt realize that was no problem if there‚Äôs a way get current design approved in as soon as we get country this is required for each country as no approval system probably start receiving final are many approvals around lower latitude states need more satellites in so probably several thousand more beta participation invitations going out this week new design is better with many minor even the small details very close to actual expected i could not be more excited about the new that while it is considerably i don‚Äôt think it necessarily requires all that much incremental _ maybe in a month or so _ it‚Äôs basically a tank from the future that‚Äôs so yeah _ team is making great factory will be an yes penguin random house üò¥ should change the name to random although it might be quite a short lot can go but we‚Äôll provide warts you will see every frame that we this is what matters most we‚Äôve tested a version in a wind tunnel with active closing the loop for so it will probably work at but reality tends to bite you on the ass lord of the if it fails right at the some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the minor understanding exactly how the body flaps control yaw roll during such that the ship is positioned well to flip would be a big win a right off launch pad is also is almost controlled descent with body flaps would be transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks relight would be a major every 5 to days faults will never be but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human we measure this primarily in intervention this update addressed several resulting in perhaps fewer many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka true for most beta releases in my thanks to a great team working super doing without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they‚Äôre reality is the hardest latency will improve significantly bandwidth this build should be noticeably better with interventions yes spent more than half my life in love the i think ca has the like a sports team with many it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency a sense of and is still right with zero deaths fewer heart as way easier to pump blood in now we‚Äôre is in the constellation scrotum small the sun converts over 4 million tons of mass to energy every

repairs or most of the factory had no equipment at even light bulbs were missing in some gm took everything that worked moved it to their other all that was left were broken bots equipment hardly worth the scrap metal but we scrounged up spare fixed the trusty old bots brought the factory back to
