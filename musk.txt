   If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.  A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.   Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
   Yes
  Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has ‚Äúspare‚Äù performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.  Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.
 _Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
 I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.
   Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it‚Äôs not a gamechanger.
   Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster
 Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
  There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.
_Soichi ‚ô•Ô∏è üáØüáµ
 Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.   Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.
 SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.

  The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not  ordered as an option.
Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing.   Note: word ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.

_bickett    Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.

 _Cooney     Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
 _Cooney     He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.
_Cooney     That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
_Cooney     Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
  T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.

  Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.   What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.

  A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I‚Äôm asking the wrong question, what is a better question?
_lab  !
 Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.
 Just a scratch. We can buff it out.
 Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold.

_nunez  Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 &amp; N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of today‚Äôs test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.

_H  _roi  Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford ü§£ü§£. General public doesn‚Äôt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
 The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you‚Äôre probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?
_H _roi  This a great reference! Worth a read.
Case closed  
Soon  
 Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not
  Note, this is not the spike protein. They don‚Äôt consider that reliable.
  Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.
 Strange
 Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
 Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.
 From

Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What‚Äôs the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
 Interesting
_beans  Interesting
What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
  A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.   False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic:  
  Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
 Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so ‚ÄúElon Musk Tests Negative for Covid‚Äù is an equally correct title. The ‚Äúrapid antigen test‚Äù from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
The carousel turns ever faster
  Yup
 Exactly
 Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
 If it‚Äôs happening to me, it‚Äôs happening to others. I‚Äôm getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
 Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We‚Äôll have to swap out at least one of the engines.

  Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.
   Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time ‚Äî from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.
  I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt.
 That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didn‚Äôt own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.

 Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge

   Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw &amp; roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip &amp; land, would be a big win
  But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
  Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.

   Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
  We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.
 Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard!   Doing ‚Äúneural nets‚Äù without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they‚Äôre doing. Reality is the hardest sim.

  To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.   Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.  GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories.
 All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life.
 And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.

 Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.   R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.

 Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It‚Äôs just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.
 With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn‚Äôt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it‚Äôs right.
  Thank you, much more accurate haha
 This graph appears to be upside down
 Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
  Will release order configurator probably in Jan
 Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers.
  The SoC‚Äôs sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it‚Äôs fairly obvious when one is discordant
 Tesla FSD computer‚Äôs dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes ‚Äî they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.

 Definitely
_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the ‚Äúpoor inventor‚Äù card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard‚Äôs problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze‚Äôev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO.

 Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   It‚Äôs already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.

    The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
_Enough  Sandy Munro understands engineering
    That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
   Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
   Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
  But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
  Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
  The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
  Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it‚Äôs fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
 Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
 Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
 We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
 Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.

 Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US &amp; hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval.
  We‚Äôre not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
  Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that‚Äôs needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
 Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year.
4th flight &amp; landing for this booster
5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
 So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car‚Äôs exhaust pipe.
 It‚Äôs a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.

   _M_Brown       Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
  _M_Brown       High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
 _M_Brown        Great
_M_Brown        Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity ‚Äî needs several more Starlink launches. I‚Äôm using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
      Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As we‚Äôre able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
        Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
       Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
     Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn‚Äôt required for Mars, so 4 is possible
     Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
  Yeah
     Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we‚Äôre actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded.
    The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.

 _AA_Carmack Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
 _AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.
 _AA_Carmack Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.
 _AA_Carmack  You really want waypoints this much?
_AA_Carmack For Dojo, we‚Äôre betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.

   Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
   Mostly for employees, but we‚Äôll support public access whenever it‚Äôs safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
   Absolutely üòÉ üèù
  I don‚Äôt want be cavalier, but there isn‚Äôt an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.
  I‚Äôve been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though.
 _ai _com Dojo V1.0 isn‚Äôt done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
_stve Scorcher VI  
  _Bass3d   Yes
Elevator music is underrated
 _Bass3d   It‚Äôs counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
 Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you‚Äôre roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3
    Yes, it will have huge nuts haha
 We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!

  Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so they‚Äôre actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.
  üí®
  That‚Äôs engine SN. We‚Äôre building SN8 of the ship.
 SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding!  
 Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We‚Äôll do lots of flights.
_Bass3d    Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; there‚Äôll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.

 We‚Äôre seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially ‚Äúno symptoms‚Äù, are false positives.

   Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac &amp; possibly others
   In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem.
  As you‚Äôd expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.
 Seems fishy
   ü§£ü§£ very true

    Extremely big difference between died because of or died with. Also, did the person actually have C19 or did they just have C19 symptoms? It‚Äôs almost impossible to die without feeling weakness, shortness of breath or other C19 symptoms, unless you were crushed by a falling piano.
Your GPS just got slightly better
_hart  This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
   If accurate, this would explain a lot
  Levitt is right
 There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none.
    Very much agree
  Good hygiene always makes sense
 True
_Watts @_TomCross_  _Museum Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
  
 There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.
Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla.

_Maelstrom _J_Beck    Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner ‚Äústiffness‚Äù, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.
 Tank didn‚Äôt burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We‚Äôre developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
_J_Beck    Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that‚Äôs already mixed.
  Yes
 That‚Äôs the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.

_feed Wow
  _Crew  _Doug   ‚ù§Ô∏è the laser beam long exposure shots
   Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it‚Äôs 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration ‚Ä¶
_Gardi  Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I‚Äôd call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast  
  Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.
  We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights.
After which they are recycled  
Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km  
Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories  
Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount  

Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets  
 _feed Haha. Will post summary.
 Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
 Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80‚Äôs as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.

     Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
    Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.
   San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.
  Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.

 It‚Äôs true

   Yes, this is a high priority
    Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%
  Pain can certainly be turned off, but we‚Äôre not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet
   Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
   That‚Äôs harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
  Ok
 !
     No, but it‚Äôs mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)
_smb  It‚Äôs not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.
 To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.
     Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
    Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
    Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.

 Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms.
   It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator
   Sure :)
  Way more important than it sounds
 Yeah!!
    A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.
    SLS makes me feel sad
  No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded
  Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
 A great mystery of the universe
 It‚Äôs so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
   Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!
  _nyker   Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life.

   Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
  These won‚Äôt be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.
 Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated.
_csquared   As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it

 I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn‚Äôt just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind.
  Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter.
  Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
 Probably 3 to 6 months
 Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as ‚Äúventilator‚Äù, but makes many good points  
 You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It‚Äôs very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are ‚Äúreal ventilators‚Äù.

   Exactly
 What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
‚ÄúDr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning‚Äù. Yup.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt jump to intubation.‚Äù ‚Äî Dr Caputo
   _Wachter A mask or nose ‚Äúventilator‚Äù with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you‚Äôre fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.
  _Wachter Sounds about right  
 _Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I‚Äôm hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
 _Wachter I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington
   _Wachter We‚Äôre working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
_Wachter They were, but are they currently?
  _Wachter Interesting
_Wachter We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.
  __tire          Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
    _psyd      _J_Beck Sure
   _psyd      _J_Beck Production is by *far* the hard part. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they‚Äôre pretty sweet ‚Ä¶
    _psyd      _J_Beck SN4 won‚Äôt get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.
    _psyd      _J_Beck That‚Äôs for sure! üòÖ
   _psyd      _J_Beck I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It‚Äôs very hard. I‚Äôm spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done üòÄ
 __tire          My (again) personal favorite is  
  _psyd       Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially . Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn‚Äôt scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it‚Äôs probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
__tire          Vast majority of ‚Äúventilators‚Äù are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient‚Äôs throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.  
 _psyd       SN26
_psyd       Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It‚Äôs a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!
         The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
     Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
     Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.
        Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.  
    Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.
   Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
   Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
   Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.
  Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That‚Äôs the acid test.
 True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they‚Äôd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.
To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it‚Äôs hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
 You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
 There‚Äôs tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!
Giga Berlin will have world‚Äôs most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature

    In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable.
    The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea:  
   Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible.
 A lot has happened in 8 years

Raptors  
     Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, we‚Äôre going to reuse much of the thrust section.
    Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe.
    Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.
    There are redundant pressure control valves. It‚Äôs a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
    If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you‚Äôre doomed anyway, so might as well go all in
We‚Äôre adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
   Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.

  Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who‚Äôs behind it.
   Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.
  Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
  Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical.
  Will call when we reach Mars

 Yes, v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. Need wider span, longer stroke &amp; ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds.

  Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you‚Äôre expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.
    This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
   Sure would love to do home hvac that‚Äôs quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter
   Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast &amp; extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
  The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
 Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I‚Äôve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.

_feed Nice
 This is great advice
  _a  Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there‚Äôs anything else you need.
   We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part.
  Supply chain logistics ‚Äî getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  ‚Äî is the main issue we‚Äôre hearing from ER physicians
  _a You‚Äôre most welcome. We‚Äôre working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
  Panic is always dumb
  Italy: ‚ÄúOn re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.‚Äù
 Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
 We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
    No problem :)
    Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
   Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
   Fair point :)
    Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too.  
  Up to 80% false positive
  Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I‚Äôve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and ‚Äúpresumed positive‚Äù.  
 Important consideration
 Feels like the plot of Deus Ex  
 A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk
  Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too
 That won‚Äôt work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can‚Äôt stay open
 Yes, we‚Äôre working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won‚Äôt be needed
 Interesting thread
  Thanks üíñ
 China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
  We‚Äôre working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
 Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important.
   
  Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
 Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
 Yes
No new domestic corona cases in China  
 Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart:  
  Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
_Mosseri   _Astronauts Yes
  True
 Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn‚Äôt happened already.
 Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?
  We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
  
 Some helpful data from Italy  
 Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases, not oft-reported ‚Äúpresumptive positive‚Äù is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China.   
 0% chance of anything close
  ü§£ü§£
  How does this compare to favipiravir?  
  Yeah, that will be a great milestone üòÄ
  Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isn‚Äôt a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won‚Äôt risk non-SpaceX satellites.

Hydroxychloroquine probably better

 Was also given a lot of doxycycline  
 Maybe helpful
 Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would‚Äôve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn‚Äôt mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing.

 Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!
 Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!

  It‚Äôs slightly better
 Definitely worth trying imo
 Btw, in some prior tweets I‚Äôd said production Cybertruck would be ~80‚Äù wide (vs ~84‚Äù body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82‚Äù, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
 Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Science has gone too far  
üî≠  
  F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
  It‚Äôs mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.
 Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
 LOX
 These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
 Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
 _ev Probably
_ev Attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow Starship to the launch pad
 I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!  
  The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
  There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.
  Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters.
 O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank
 In the order that they were written

_mac Coming hopefully later this year
 I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
 No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it‚Äôs very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.

   Haha true
 You‚Äôre welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
  Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.
   No, they‚Äôre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
  Yes, we‚Äôre tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area
 That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it‚Äôs built inside a factory in volume.
 This isn‚Äôt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that‚Äôs 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.

    First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
   Ok sure üòÄ Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
       Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I‚Äôm unaware of

 PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.
  The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.
_Psyche Sorry!
 A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what‚Äôs truly hard). Don‚Äôt care if you even graduated high school.

 That‚Äôs the goal
 Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
 Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit
Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
 _Big_Mike  That‚Äôs about right
 Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September
  What‚Äôs amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.
  Densification isn‚Äôt needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it‚Äôs an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed
 Fundamental issue with SLS is that it‚Äôs not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! üíØ tragedy.
 Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

 Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank ‚Äî it‚Äôs just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don‚Äôt collapse when depressurized on the ground.
   Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.
   A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
   Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.

_Gardi  Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque.
  Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard

 Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It‚Äôs like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!

   We‚Äôre focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
 Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
  Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.
 No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor
   Yeah
 Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.
 Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.
 We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.
Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome ü§£ü§£

  Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don‚Äôt try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.
  Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.
_turrell  Pretty much
  Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
 No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it‚Äôs getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.
   That might have something to do with it. ‚ÄúStalin: Court of the Red Tsar‚Äù was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they‚Äôd listened to Lenin‚Äôs last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.

  Exactly
 Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I‚Äôve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone.
__Wakefield   _cyber  @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford.

 Activating engine two ‚Ä¶
    It is an honor &amp; a privilege to work with so many great engineers
   The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
   It‚Äôs not that these things can‚Äôt be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware.
 Future feature
Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all.
  Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone‚Äôs on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!
  Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home.
 We‚Äôre building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
 Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
 Most people still don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there
Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar

  _raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
 _raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

  We‚Äôre creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we‚Äôll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can‚Äôt be made using standard methods.
 Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can‚Äôt stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press

  Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
  SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
  Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
   Pretty much
_cadle   Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
  No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?
  So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable

  No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.
 Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
 If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
 Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
 The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
 Gas/diesel cars too
 True

 This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called ‚ÄúPitch Day‚Äù &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don‚Äôt buy APCs. It‚Äôs the Air Force.
  Fair point. Coming soon. We‚Äôre making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
 Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
 More to come
_burrough Yes
  Would be odd to expect anything else
_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
 Great poem
Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we‚Äôve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row.
 Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called ‚ÄúLow Gear‚Äù!

  Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong
 Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there‚Äôs a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.

 Very true. Glass doesn‚Äôt burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to   to add solar to an existing roof &amp;   for a new roof with integrated solar.
We don‚Äôt make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot
If you‚Äôre directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today
Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires
 So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important.   
  I‚Äôd recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs

Anyone who‚Äôs interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing ‚Äî designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine ‚Äî please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We‚Äôre gonna take this to a whole new level!
 Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I‚Äôm in awe.
So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It‚Äôs insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you ‚Ä¶
          Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I‚Äôve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
          Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
And the lead character is also named Woody  
     Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
     Conservation of energy tells you the answer
_Oolsen  _Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
    We def could be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
     Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table
     Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
    Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
    Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.  
    This is true. All that matters is number used in ‚àÜv equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.  
  _Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.

  _addicted Yeah, great team!
_ump_er  _Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth.  
  _Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
 _Station Most people aren‚Äôt aware that orbit (and ‚Äúzero‚Äù gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.

_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.

 _SPACE There‚Äôs so much power going through this engine that it‚Äôs close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
__99   _SPACE Yes
 _SPACE Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it.

_ShadowZone  For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
  Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
 Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
 Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
 It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating

   Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
  For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
 Current analysis, which I‚Äôm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
 Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward ‚Äúfin‚Äù would simply be used as a leg.
 Stability is not an issue with 3
 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.

_ Wise words from Gary the Bot
However, we won‚Äôt customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  
    Exactly! We‚Äôve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
   Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
   That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it
   At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
  The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
    Agreed
   Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
  There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
 Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
  Hopefully, next year

 The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
        Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
     Precisely
    Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you‚Äôll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you‚Äôre prob ok.

Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes
 Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system‚Äôs fusion reactor (the sun).
   True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
 Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
  Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
 Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming
  ü§£ü§£
Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites üõ∞ to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)

  Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
  Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
  Wearing black not recommended  
  High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren‚Äôt hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

 This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket &amp; space station technology. Great respect.
   No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot

‚ÄúIf you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.‚Äù ‚Äî Gen Shinseki
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
 Probably
 Agreed. That‚Äôs approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
    Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them &amp; we won‚Äôt be able to.
     No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
    If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week
  Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.

    To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car
    Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time, thousands.
  Upgrading to 250kW soon
   Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.
 _spb  Local supporters will be invited!
    Yes
   ~Q4 2016
   End of Q4, most likely
   Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won‚Äôt diverge until Q4, as it‚Äôs limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.
  This is why it‚Äôs possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars
  All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer

  FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.
  Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
 Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.

Design &amp; production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible  
 2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
  _preece      That‚Äôs actually kinda true
     Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
    You‚Äôre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We‚Äôre fixing that with Starship.
 _Majoris_6  That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney‚Äôs Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you‚Äôd exit on another continent.
_Majoris_6  ~1000, as all seats would be ‚Äúcoach‚Äù &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It‚Äôs basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
 About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
  That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low
_Games  There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
  Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
 Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
  Probably sooner
 Ok
     Sure, that would be an honor
   Most likely. It is programmed to do so.

Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
  High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.

   üñ§ Tesla Software Engineering üñ§
Falcon Heavy on LC-39A  
    All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó
     It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
     Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
     Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
    Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
 So cool
  Anything with high contrast
  Excessive shades of grey
 Yeah, we‚Äôve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
    Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.
  Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
 Haha
_mckirdy     Depends on destination
    Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
    Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
 Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite  
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
   More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
   Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
  Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

    Good idea
   True. I‚Äôm a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
 Yup
    Would love to do exactly that
_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We‚Äôll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.
    Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we‚Äôll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.
_Gardi     Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
     Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
  Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers
    If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that‚Äôs easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map.    
   There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won‚Äôt be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible.  
  No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
 Fair
  Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
 Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
   Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
  Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
 Opposite is true: you can have 100‚Äôs of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below

    Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber.
        _Sword   Horizontally
        _Sword   First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20.
 So it goes
        _Sword   3 months
       _Sword   Hopefully, 4 months
      _Sword   Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
     _Sword   Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees

 No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of.

Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels

When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt obvious.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?

  Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year.
      As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed.
    Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone

   Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that‚Äôs a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.

 Wow, a lot of people don‚Äôt know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
 There is 35 GWh/yr ‚Äútheoretical capacity‚Äù, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3‚Äôs in Q1 due to cell constraints.
  Yes
 Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date
  Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn‚Äôt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability

 There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
 Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
  Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
 Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won‚Äôt spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

    We‚Äôre going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.
   Annoying that  perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can‚Äôt. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that‚Äôs very rare.
   Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year‚Äôs vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.
  Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what‚Äôs there. Not impossible.
 Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
 Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward ‚ÄúHW3‚Äù will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important.
   Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
  Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.

Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
 Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.  Yes, but we‚Äôre going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads.
 Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.

       Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.
 Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.

   You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
    Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
_REAL_KEAGAN     Agreed
   Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.

   Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity.
   Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions.

 _cga _benton   In retrospect, lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
 However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
_cga _benton   When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.

   Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time
 We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide.
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.
Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%.

        _of_racing    Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight.
          _of_racing    SN2 has changes that should help
         _of_racing    To the first part. I doubt we‚Äôd create a Dyson ring or sphere.
         _of_racing    Yes
         _of_racing    Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done.
        _of_racing    Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun.
       _of_racing    Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space.
     _of_racing    You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
     _of_racing    Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
   Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
_CO  We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done
    _of_racing    Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ‚ò∫Ô∏èHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
   _of_racing    That‚Äôs true üòÄ Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
   Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
  Don‚Äôt know
 SpaceX commercial üöÄ launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years.  
   Exactly. That‚Äôs the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
_of_racing    SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I‚Äôm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.
 So true ü§° John Clarke üëå
  Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner
_Heats  Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
 That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don‚Äôt have any crypto holdings.
 I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes.  
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.
 Won‚Äôt be long before they do
Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019

  Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI &amp; I didn‚Äôt agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up &amp; it was just better to part ways on good terms.

     On my bedside table
    A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
   _Gardi  Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress &amp; setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!
   _Gardi  The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship‚Äôs success
  _Gardi  At least 10X cheaper
  _Gardi  Very dependent on volume, but I‚Äôm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.
  _Gardi  Yes
 _Gardi  This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9
 _Gardi  Close
_Gardi  But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
   Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
@_cgp  Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
_Gardi  Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
  I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
  About 11 secs
  Definitely! It‚Äôs amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by  engine/test team!  
  I was simply too sexy for it

Joe Rogan describes Tesla for 4 mins &amp; 20 secs  
  _Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry
 _Gardi  Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
 _Gardi  Rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
  Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
 Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.
 The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just ‚ÄúStarship‚Äù &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy

  Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart
 Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn‚Äôt even need paint!
     Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
    Mostly true
  Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won‚Äôt need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
  Yes
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at  Texas  
   Yes. It‚Äôs very rare to find all three.
  To be clear, I‚Äôm confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding
  Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9
  Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack
  Absolutely. You‚Äôve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

  Actual tanks are fine
 ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
  I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp
 Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
  Since it‚Äôs part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it
Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
_Space   Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.
 Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
 When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

   I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
  Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it‚Äôs not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings
 How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
  Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX
  The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication
 The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

_Cautillo Wow!
_Richards   This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!  If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:  
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc

        This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
       We‚Äôre building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
       Exactly
      For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.
      Yes
     I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we‚Äôre building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April
     Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless!
    While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design
    Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
 If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference
 Coming soon
 It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end
  Try connecting to WiFi
Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can‚Äôt take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.  Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at   or visit stores.

Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that  built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:  
Join our underground movement!
 Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out
   Ok üòÄüí®
     Autopilot doesn‚Äôt need the guide wheels. They‚Äôre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?  
     Exactly
    The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
 Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.
  Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.
   Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.
  You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear.
 Pop up, park and walk!
 I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy
A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.
Next step for  Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
   Precisely
Presentation starting at 8:15
  This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start
  Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it‚Äôs time to upgrade to something better.
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.
  Yes
This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla

 About 10 to 14 days
Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)
Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.   To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at   or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can‚Äôt deliver your car this year.
 No need to wait. It‚Äôs super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.

  You‚Äôre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with  tell a more interesting story.
  We‚Äôre opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week.

 This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
       60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party.
 We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
 Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability.
Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.
  Machete!!
 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.
Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn‚Äôt exist or would have started much later.  
 Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China.
 Buying   took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn‚Äôt like   even when we were only making üöò.
Tesla history trivia: we didn‚Äôt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.
     Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring
    But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
    Yes
 Interesting
    Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong
    The new design is metal
   As far as we know, it‚Äôs the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn‚Äôt need heat shielding or even paint.
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing  
Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon.  
 Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.
 We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
 Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.
Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.

   We‚Äôre adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months
 Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there‚Äôs no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here.
 It is so hard to move in armor!
 You‚Äôre all hired!

  _maas Ok
 _maas Good advice
   Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We‚Äôre also working on vision-only driving.
  Glad you‚Äôre ok
_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.
_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.
 Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon

 This is completely backwards. Based on what we‚Äôve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we‚Äôre moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won‚Äôt need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.
Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive.

Renaming BFR to Starship
_sci No, we‚Äôre just going to accelerate BFR
 Yes
Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
  No, it‚Äôs got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
   In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
   What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
  Lot on our plate, so it‚Äôs either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.
  Ok
 Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That‚Äôs a great van. We will inquire.
 Absolutely agree
 Investigating
  Probably mid 2019
_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
 Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.

Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
 Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive.
 Radical change
Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.
 It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.

Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.
 We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
 Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it‚Äôs better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location.

@_sheateher  Is he ok?
It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.
 Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
 Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)
Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for ‚Äúgrant money‚Äù. They earn ü•ú vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
 That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
We know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far ‚Ä¶
 Because people on the ground know more about what‚Äôs actually needed than politicians do
 Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3.
If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.
  Fair point, will reenable
 Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety.

  No, we‚Äôre building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas

    Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
   To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
   Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
 Amazing results by  at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!

  Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
 Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone.
Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldn‚Äôt be here without you.
  Same
 2025
How‚Äôd they know!?  
 Around mid 2019
  There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past.
 Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
 Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn‚Äôt look like a radiator grill opening.
Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there‚Äôs no such thing as a Tesla ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week.
To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want.
 Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars
 Working on it

 Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so
 It‚Äôs kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see.
Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don‚Äôt use sport/summer tires.
 It‚Äôs a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February

  New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
 Yes, aiming for next few months
 True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla‚Äôs service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
Insightful article by David 
_AA_Carmack Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you‚Äôre one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day.
  _brorsson   The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
 _brorsson   I believe it‚Äôs $5k
 _brorsson   ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
_brorsson   Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
  To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.
  This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.
  Still a long way to go

 Yes
Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you.

   Yes, it‚Äôs hard to find. Not sure why.
   Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSA‚Äôs *own* calculations. This is just physics!

  Fair point üòÄ
 When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they‚Äôre just ‚Äúpassive‚Äù managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!
 Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative ‚Äî it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  
 V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
 Only if they‚Äôre extremely tiny
 We don‚Äôt judge. Any pic you want!

  _nafnlaus  The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
  _nafnlaus  The big funds can &amp; will, as they‚Äôre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for ‚Äúpassive‚Äù index tracking.
  _nafnlaus  Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder
 _nafnlaus  Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don‚Äôt realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.
 _nafnlaus  There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators
 I hope to be less wrong over time
  You‚Äôre most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
What they do should be illegal
The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
    _Enforcement Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two  
          This is amazing  
 Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to 1000 more users a few days ago.
People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value.
  If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy.
 Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine.
  True
  Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It‚Äôs what they do.
Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!

 Probably 2028 for a base to be built
Mars Base Alpha  

 Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.
 Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.
 Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at  
 Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
  A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
 Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side
 Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts
Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
   Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. ‚Äú5 star‚Äù just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much.
  Haha true

 Sorry, it‚Äôs not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesn‚Äôt incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier.
 Yes
_scottv Yeah, that‚Äôs our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks.
 Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting 1000‚Äôs of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference.
Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour.
Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy

Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it‚Äôs contingent on a shareholder vote.
 Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
 Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)
 No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private
 Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
 My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we‚Äôre private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity‚Äôs SpaceX investment.
 Yes
 I don‚Äôt have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldn‚Äôt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won‚Äôt be selling in either scenario.

 Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.

  It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
    _Wheel _Ideas  Makes a lot of sense
 This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it‚Äôs there for anyone who needs it in future. Something‚Äôs messed up if this is not a good thing.

_kistler  Ironically, the ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn‚Äôt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.
  Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.
  Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point
 Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
 The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as ‚Äúrescue chief‚Äù) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:  
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
  Ok
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids‚Äô soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.  
_Man  That would be cool. I wonder what it‚Äôs like under all that ice.
 _online A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
 Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
_online According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.

 I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz ‚Ä¶
   It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
 Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.
   Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.
__  Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.
   
 Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They‚Äôre prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
  Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it‚Äôs on a plane to Thailand
 Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.

 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.
  I‚Äôm in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
 Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand
Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.
 Ground winds would
 Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It‚Äôs a beast.
 Can‚Äôt be too buoyant
Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.
     Good idea
    Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.
 You‚Äôre welcome. Happy birthday! üéÅüéâüéÇ
   Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
     Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
 It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
  Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
 I would def recommend this
  Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
   Interesting
  Great, thanks
 Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
  So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won‚Äôt come in
  Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.
 SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
 Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.
  So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.
  Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
  Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.
 Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
_long  Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
    I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said
  I didn‚Äôt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don‚Äôt work for me. They just don‚Äôt like hypocrites.
 They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don‚Äôt use Facebook.
   Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was ‚Äúdancing her face off‚Äù with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?  
_Padival  Why did  publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos‚Äôs cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective  
_Padival    
_Padival  . posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption ‚ÄúLove both these dudes‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt sound very objective  
  Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so.
    Are you 100% certain that  stands by  &amp; supports everything she‚Äôs done? Why won‚Äôt Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
       _Padival   Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
    True
    _Padival  So  publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla‚Äôs most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is ‚Äúone of the greatest.‚Äù Her articles print Chanos‚Äôs view verbatim. This is not journalism.
  _Padival  . You stated publicly that you ‚Äúsee eye to eye‚Äù with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?
 What a coincidence ‚Ä¶
   Am not attacking all media or even all of . Just asked if you inform public about an analyst‚Äôs prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
 _Padival  Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: , did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?
  Exactly. , I just asked a simple question. Please answer.
_Enough      Strange. , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their opinion.
Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself.  
_Padival  Sounds very sketchy if true. , is it possible you‚Äôre  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla‚Äôs biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?
_Padival  has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible.
    Wow, so  of  wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work  &amp; .
  ., why did you mislead the people public about this number?
  . is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target.

   No standard automotive solution could be built in time, so we created a new solution. It is working &amp; has slightly higher quality than the more traditional general assembly line. Perhaps most surprising is that the total cost of production in the Sprung tent is lower.
 All Tesla vehicles come with cabin overheat protection  
  I hate whole idea of brands and branding. So much bs. I hope it messes with our brand. Brands suck.
 Sir, this will not be some a dainty little buttercup of a truck! Driver‚Äôs seat will be big enough to fit Andr√© the giant (love that guy).
 400 to 500 mile option definitely. Higher, maybe.
 For sure
 Should be easy to add as a feature like calendar
You‚Äôre welcome!  
 Yes. Highly recommend doing so btw.
 That will be standard
 That goes without saying  
_hippie 300,000 lb towing capacity
 It will
 For sure! When doing US govt crash safety testing, the Model S roof was so strong, it broke their testing machine.  
 Wow, great idea! Since it will already have a Tesla pneumatics system, it totally makes sense to add a utility port.
Pickup truck will have power outlets allowing use of heavy duty 240V, high power tools in field all day. No generator needed.
The Tesla Truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard.
 It will parallel park automatically &amp; have 360 degree cameras &amp; sonar
What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck? I have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances &amp; what would be seriously next level?
   ‚ÄúVirtue signaling‚Äù is super annoying &amp; there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks, but jump on every social cause du jour. But I‚Äôm really proud of the fact that # of changes Tesla had to make to achieve 100/100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero.
  Don‚Äôt buy our car if that‚Äôs a problem. People should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíúüñ§üíñüåà
  Then you will really hate that Tesla scored 100/100 four years in a row on LGBTQ equality  
          We must aspire to truth
         Important to read the Wash Post article. The ‚Äúunable to account for‚Äù number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.
 Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
         True
        We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate
        ‚Äú‚Ä¶ of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS‚Äôs phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing‚Äù
        ‚ÄúAll 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond‚Äù
        This Washington Post article seems good  
 As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all.
 This doesn‚Äôt take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.
  A billion at most, so 20% max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint.
 Humanity is not perfect, but it‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got
 Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn‚Äôt have happened at all.
  Let‚Äôs find out. It would be amazing to encounter an alien civilization, provided it is not their invasion fleet! üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏ üõ∏

 Yes
 Yes, we are essentially a steward of life &amp; duty-bound imo to ensure its continuance
 Life is good
It is unknown whether we are the only civilization currently alive in the observable universe, but any chance that we are is added impetus for extending life beyond Earth
This is why we must preserve the light of consciousness by becoming a spacefaring civilization &amp; extending life to other planets  
 So strange
_Ryan   Critical autonomous safety features like emergency braking are standard, but convenience features like active cruise control are not
 _Ebright It‚Äôs a tough call. Reality is that it will be pretty easy to bully a self-driving car, as it will always yield. Will prob have a manual override that requires continuous press for hardcore lane changes.

 Was thinking of offering an extended Tesla factory tour option where you could help build part of a car &amp; understand how they come together. I know it would have been super fun for me when I was a kid (or now).
_  It‚Äôs called Top Secret
 Yes
  _Padival   When I was a kid, I built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college.
 _Padival   Yeah, but I‚Äôm not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too, even better.
   We will add a config to lower the alert

_Padival   It‚Äôs actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people &amp; good for environment. I think that‚Äôs fundamental goodness.

 There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That‚Äôs still ~40 people.
      Today. It‚Äôs kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.

 Because honey is a vegetable
   Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
     Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.
    Exactly
    He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.
 Great name. A little on the nose.
   That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is.
  Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

    _CA Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
 _fan_93    It‚Äôs actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
   Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
  They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it‚Äôs way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
   No
 Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ‚ô•Ô∏èüöòüí´
  You‚Äôre welcome, bad fiction writer 78  
  Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can‚Äôt even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer.
 Your union brothers  
 You won‚Äôt find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
_Wasserman    Thanks, good advice
  They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
 Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I‚Äôm driving.
     Can‚Äôt wait for the new  season to start!
 We‚Äôve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.
 Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
    Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.
    I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.
_rodgers They started it &amp; attacked me personally
Search UAW and ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù. Very long reading list. Great organization.  
    ‚ÄúProfit‚Äù just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years &amp; we‚Äôre almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt.

   You‚Äôre just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I‚Äôd fail &amp; be back in 3 months.
 I don‚Äôt want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.
  You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That‚Äôs a very bigoted position.
Well said  
 Then you‚Äôll be fine
  _______   Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
 _______   ...which clearly doesn‚Äôt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they‚Äôre getting desperate.
 _______  Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.
 _______   More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
 How big is your short position? Just curious.
 _______   Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
 I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
_______   UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
  I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too.
  I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
  _ray  Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.
 Iain certainly wasn‚Äôt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn‚Äôt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that‚Äôs a special case.

   That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.

  Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good.

By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all.

  No
 My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
 There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation.
Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people‚Äôs freedom.

 _Lima_Bean   Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
_Lima_Bean   Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It‚Äôs what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust ‚Äî literally bulletproof.

_MCEM  Add an R for Roadster üëΩüíïüöÄ
 Sigh. This is crux of matter: can‚Äôt make system too annoying or people won‚Äôt use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
_thewalls   A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
 Yes. Hopefully, I‚Äôm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.
 Will do
  Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there‚Äôs no escaping Newton‚Äôs Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
 You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be another.
 Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.
 Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the ‚Äúhalo crown‚Äù effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
   That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
This is why I‚Äôm not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I‚Äôd know everything‚Äôs fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh ü§î
Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.
_remick  20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your üß† like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?‚Ç¨}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
 In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company‚Äôs name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
 That‚Äôs quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents  
At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps.
More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)
  We don‚Äôt think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
 Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way‚Ä¶
SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly ‚Ä¶

_Soul  Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won‚Äôt offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value.
 Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It‚Äôs a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week‚Äôs.

 Usually, they don‚Äôt even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so.
  Actually true!
  Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.
 But don‚Äôt worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything‚Äôs just fine  
 Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car‚Äôs exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.
 The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
Glad you‚Äôre ok!  
Some details on the Tesla air filtration system  
_uk Mid 2019 for RHD
 That sounds like a fun adventure!
_uk You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
 Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little ü•ú on S/X.
Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind  
   Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3.
Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus

 Hi ! üíïüëªüòÖ
  _g_fischer  Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
Hell of a week  
 Just for perspective  
   True, no one is perfect
   You‚Äôre most welcome. More to come in this regard.
  Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism.
  Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there‚Äôs always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%.
 _Pivac Prob 8.3
_Pivac Yes
All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say ‚Äúbug report‚Äù followed by issue description.  
_d   ‚ÄúPneumatic‚Äù means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
 _g_fischer  Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you‚Äôre really bothered by them, don‚Äôt replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort.
_g_fischer  Yeah, absolutely
Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from . Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.  
Like you guys too üöò üñ§  
 Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered.

   Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I‚Äôm against science is like saying Beyonc√© doesn‚Äôt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.
    Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn‚Äôt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don‚Äôt have the right to deny false accusations? That‚Äôs messed up.
   You‚Äôve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I‚Äôm against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don‚Äôt represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too

 Reddit is great
Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media.
        Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don‚Äôt realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
      Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.

If you‚Äôre in media &amp; don‚Äôt want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it ‚Ä¶
 ü§ó
 I‚Äôve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven‚Äôt forgotten UAW betrayed them. That‚Äôs why UAW can‚Äôt even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.
 Of course
  It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we‚Äôre doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company.
  No, they‚Äôre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously
 Will do
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
_io That‚Äôs why editors are included too
 We don‚Äôt. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
Even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.
 Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
 Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
 Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army
 Exactly
Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda ‚Ä¶
  An exception that proves the rule
 Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?
Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest advertisers.
 The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
 Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
 Thought you‚Äôd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like Trump!‚Äù Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.
The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them  
   This will sound super obvious, but Genesis &amp; Oblivion

      None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts
     Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)
 Great idea!
     Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.

    Interesting he stops at ‚Äò09. That‚Äôs when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
 Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It‚Äôs an off-menu item for those in the know üòâ
    But ya know what, let‚Äôs test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let‚Äôs hold a vote &amp; find out.
   In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.
We‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?
 Good point
    No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class ‚Äúlords &amp; commoners‚Äù system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.
    More ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they‚Äôve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article ‚Ä¶
      No problem
      They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.
_Ryan  Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!
      I didn‚Äôt meet with him
 I definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can‚Äôt be creative otherwise.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
    Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.
_Ryan  Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.
   To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production.
   ABS calibration algorithm
  Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
  Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.
 _Ryan  Stop, you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è
_Ryan  Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little
_Ryan  Complexity is the devil. Words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we‚Äôll try.
   Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.
 The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3‚Äôs have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we‚Äôve seen anything like this.
  Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3‚Äôs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers
  Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
    _Letson Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com.
    Gwynne‚Äôs awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
    ‚ô•Ô∏èü¶Ñ
   Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.
   Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
   Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal.

_remick  _ivaylo It can tow far more than rated capacity
 _ivaylo Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
_ivaylo With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.
    That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
   Exactly üöÄüí´üéâ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what‚Äôs happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
   Yeah, ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today‚Äôs non-union.
   About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.
_S Yes
    Exactly
   They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don‚Äôt want to.
 Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It‚Äôs like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
_Soto They are correct. It‚Äôs awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.
 It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell
  Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.
 Good idea ...
 That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
 Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks
Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.
Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range
_qasc It‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing
 Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.

Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins  
 Time will tell, but so far it appears so
 It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.
What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  
    Yes
   According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
  This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.
 Happy Mother‚Äôs Day Mom! Love you so much.

 Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week  
 No use arguing with chimp. You‚Äôre blocked.
 That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass üé© ‚Ä¶

Launching in ~4 mins  
_Ryan  AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that‚Äôs when we *start* making them. Can‚Äôt instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so.
 Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ‚Ä¶
 _Ryan I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp
_Ryan Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
 A cool thing about the design is that‚Äôs easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all

  True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
 We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter
The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors
 Exactly
First, it‚Äôs important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while  
Please ignore this thread unless you‚Äôre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
_Invest   They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
   Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.
  To be clear, I‚Äôm a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification
  The ‚Äúdry‚Äù questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.

 Uhh, hello, I need to build cars
 About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we don‚Äôt design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so I‚Äôm back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell ‚Ä¶
 Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what‚Äôs most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world‚Äôs most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.
    We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn‚Äôt matter.
   Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a really great answer ‚Ä¶
 Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?
  Seriously! Obviously, I‚Äôm not going to do an April Fool‚Äôs joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).
 Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.
   Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven

On the Westworld set with my bro   
Why Falcon Heavy &amp; Starman?  Life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after another. There need to be things that inspire you, that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity. That is why we did it. We did for you.    
 Doesn‚Äôt make any sense. You can‚Äôt ‚Äútake things that fail‚Äù &amp; make them work without creativity &amp; invention.
 No, it‚Äôs not
 None of the above
Tunnels
 Because blue
 I guess you could say it‚Äôs a 150 mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So, yes, a bus.
Better video coming soon, but it would look a bit like this:  
Boring Co urban loop system would have 1000‚Äôs of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination &amp; blend seamlessly into the fabric of a city, rather than a small number of big stations like a subway
 Definitely
Will still transport cars, but only after all personalized mass transit needs are met. It‚Äôs a matter of courtesy &amp; fairness. If someone can‚Äôt afford a car, they should go first.

 To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.
 We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.
 I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It‚Äôs like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.
 Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US
 For example, an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a  Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference
 Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints &amp; other factors.

 Very proud of the SpaceX team! Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been fifty Falcon 9 launches already. Just ten years ago, we couldn‚Äôt even reach orbit with little Falcon 1.
Falcon 9 flight 50 launches tonight, carrying Hispasat for Spain. At 6 metric tons and almost the size of a city bus, it will be the largest geostationary satellite we‚Äôve ever flown.
 Very sensible summary of supersonic flight. Obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. If boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too.
   Good points. Will add to feature list.
   Yeah, that should improve soon. Software team has been buried in Model 3 bringup and tricky bug fixes, but that‚Äôs mostly done now.
  Almost done
Deep in the hole with my boring machine. Sometimes when we touch, the honesty‚Äôs too much ...  
 Probably about a tenth of the cost and a fifth of the time
Want to clarify that as individuals, the people responsible for the high costs &amp; long timelines are almost all well-meaning, but the system of incentives is messed up
Higher safety &amp; environmental requirements &amp; labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy &amp; a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost.
And New York

_ellison  Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
  Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
 _road  East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters
 _road  No
_road  A Shortfall of Gravitas
 A third is under construction
 _ellison  Under consideration. We‚Äôve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.
_ _ellison  Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.
_ellison _   
  _ellison  Of course :)
  _ellison  Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023
 _ellison  That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.
_ellison  Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.
_ellison  The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

Customs problem solved!

Apparently, some customs agencies are saying they won‚Äôt allow shipment of anything called a ‚ÄúFlamethrower‚Äù. To solve this, we are renaming it ‚ÄúNot a Flamethrower‚Äù.
 Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich, but the features aren‚Äôt reliable enough yet

Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don‚Äôt buy one.

 Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features.
   _AA_Carmack There aren‚Äôt even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
_AA_Carmack  Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original.
_Millard  That sounds cool. Will do.

 Yeah, it‚Äôs terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized.
  Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I‚Äôd like to add.
 Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp.
 Was gonna say we‚Äôll do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun :)
 Should be in next update
 Done
 I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.
 Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it‚Äôs going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience.
Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.   So much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you‚Äôd truly love. I hope you do.  How can we improve further?
 We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks.

 However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive.
_Hart Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.
 For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses.
 Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren‚Äôt (having ‚ÄúPhD‚Äù in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That‚Äôs what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit ‚Äúexpert‚Äù.

    Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action ‚Ä¶
   The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
   Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums.
 Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today
 I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful.
 Hell yeah, with that crew, we will party like Escobar and Cobain wish they could've partied!!

 The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like.   Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself.
 The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR.

  Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us.
  Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
 I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.

Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears
Max velocity: Mach 6.9 Max altitude: 247 km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more

  Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
 At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
 Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
@_jeffreyr  _Ames  Will prob do something like that
 _Ames  Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
 Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest.

 This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least 8 seconds checking your facts.
 Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
  There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter &amp; maybe 5 to 10 that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
 One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either.

 Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense.

  Kinda have to :)
 LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
 Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions.
 Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
 An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go
 City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you.
Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly
 For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
 Support would be much appreciated!

No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long.  
 Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack &amp; peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach 8 reentry is 8X Mach 4. Intense.
 They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it‚Ä¶  
 More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
 Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours.
 Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
 Still humans
 Significantly improves control force
Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.  
Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry.  
  We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago
 Not only that, it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon
 Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
 _gilleran True, but that's a minor factor for rockets
 No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.
 They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that.
 Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups
Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.  
 Sticking to 100
 It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace
Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good
Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

  Radiation
 Groan
 But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise

Over 1000 km should be possible in a 100D with the right tires  
 Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the 3 meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts &amp; radiative view factor is low.
 No plans to change 100 kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model 3 pack is about cost reduction, not performance.
No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer  
  Cool
 That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention
 First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model 3 obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot
 Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries &amp; Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.

 Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
   Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
   Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
  I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama ‚Ä¶ Prob worth doing?

 I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world.
 Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that's something
Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought 90% prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance.
Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even tho it was almost certain to fail
They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars

  Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
 Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot.
 We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
 Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety
   Exactly
_lo Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
  There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
 HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
 Hopefully June for those too
 S for sure. It is a bigger car.
 I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3.
 Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.
 Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth.
 Almost there, plus much improved web browser
 That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
 Almost there. Probably in a few months.
  You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)
  Something cool for sure
Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
 Model 3, Model X &amp; Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software.

 The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
 Yeah
 Start taking orders in April
_angus Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.
  Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles ‚Ä¶
 The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
 If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.
 No problem :)
 Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.
 _trulli    Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...

 Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3  
 It still has one display
 Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
 The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?
 How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
 Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!
 I think so
  No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S.
 Tues/Wed
 Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
 Tues/Wed next week
_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away.
 Yes, but not until next year
 Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
_Miller Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot
 How about now?
 Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
 All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
 Definitely
Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)
 Yes
Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.
Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the "next version" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.

   Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency.

Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially 
_pton16 I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
 Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda "digitizes" DC power
 High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at  
Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC.
You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.  
 Just spoke with , Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution.
 Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control
 $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
 Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
 Will send you one

_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
 They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.
 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
 Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question
If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.
Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast‚Ä¶

  Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
 Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
 Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
 You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
 Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
 Mostly anti-drug laws
 Exactly
 The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.
 The remedy for that is changing the law
 Ok, but what's up the wigs?
 There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
 True!
Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.

 I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
 Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.
 This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.
_arexding There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely
 Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present
Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data.
 Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
 For now
 The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted
  Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
 If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically
 Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
 Yes
 Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.
Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China!  
 Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.
 Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle.
Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
 Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory
 Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
 Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot
  It might. Am not sure.
 Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.

 Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful.
 Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1.
  It will
Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
 If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week
 The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
 It will in an upcoming release later this year
 Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar &amp; sonar.
_mantyla  Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
 Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in.
If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000
New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 &amp; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
  That was a great game

 Yes, but held up by Autopilot . It def works tho in shaving 0.1 sec off 0-60mph &amp; 1/4 mile. If AP goes tmrw, then perf upgrade goes Thurs.
Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw.

 Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
 There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place.
 If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back

_kann Primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. B pillar has a glass overlay.
 Excellent safety in rollover (5 star+). That was what took so long to develop.
In addition, we reinforced the surrounding body structure for improved safety (was already 5 star in all categories).

Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.

  US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
  Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
 It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.
 With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
  Thanks. Point of calling it "beta" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect.

Yay, baby made it home!  
    autosteering chutes will be added soon
Recode interview with  and    via 
Supercharger policy explained well by :     Will post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by   
 Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
So it was good for you too ...  
Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY  
 Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.
3 mins to launch  
 There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating.
Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car  
 Flight 24 is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions.
Great image of ancient Mars  
 No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong
 Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no.
 Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.
We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true
Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.  
 _Canada Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri.
  Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.
Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises  
 Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
 Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely.
 yes
 yup
Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good.
Three's company  
_SpaceX  will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.  
Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!  
  tambi√©n te amo
 It's probably the Ambien
Definitely  
Ok  
Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.   
  _Stevens  coming soon
 Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
 I think so
 Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
I love you too!  
Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to 36,000 km above Earth  
  Thank goodness all are ok
Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses.
May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
Woohoo!!  
Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way
Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery
 yes
Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
Bioweapon Defense Mode is real   This is what happens when you turn it on:  
  Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best.
 Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
 next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
    exactly
@_andyoneal sides def, center maybe
 naturally
Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
 F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg
 No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
 No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
 Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
 Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.
Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy  
 yes
 turns out it doesn't need securing
_Elon yes
  yes, several times
 for sure :)
 things like this should be purged shortly
 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
 Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
 JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.
 System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
 of course
_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
 Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely.
 Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
 checking into it ...
 will definitely do so
_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.
 It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.
But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
 A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better
 That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)  
 Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster
 We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
By land and sea  
Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.  
Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck  
Godot   Full play  
Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where.
_AA_Carmack me too!
Great video history of Falcon 9 by Kinematic  
 needs latest update
Activate autopilot 4X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon.
  Not from us, but it's awesome
 Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not :)
  Thanks
 yes
 Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think.
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you.
 Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
_Favreau  Thanks!
   _Station Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship "Of Course I Still Love You"  
 Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none.
SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet  
 Nickel is also in nickels
 Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic.
Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation.
  the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
 yes, will go all the way to Alaska
 Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter.
 we will
 Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
 We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S to a Model X
Model X review  
 probably unwise
   won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height
 yes
 yes
  yes
 yes
 sounds good
Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells.
 Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
 yes, coming this year
 Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
 you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
@_elombardo  correct
 hopefully 0.21
  what's the link to that?
 No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
 no problem
 Will cover whole country hopefully this year
 yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster
 less
 torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
And, of course, it will have more cowbells.
Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
 yes
  Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
@_Only_Hawk   definitely
  should be addressed this year
 Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
 that's not the real steering system
_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
 Some tweaking underway
_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
  Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
 It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
 We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
 There will be an optional tow hitch.
 Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
  Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
 cool, thanks!
  Yes, if the trend continues, before
276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
Model 3 design sketches  
 We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.
 They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
 Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.
_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
 yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.
 and a few other things
Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.
 Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.
253k as of 7am this morning
 thanks!
Now 232k orders
 of course :)
 Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night.
 def on the cards for the future
 should be within a week or two max
_Milano Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car.
Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly.
Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!
 Will include India-wide Supercharger network
 sure!
 Coming in the mail
 Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
 Just order the SpaceX option package!
Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level, but that's for later‚Ä¶
 yes, will cover whole country
 yes
 sure is
 X and S will also be available
Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland.
Model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person
Online ordering at   will now open at 7:30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at 8:30.
 From almost anywhere
 Coming soon!
Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up.
Model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm California time at  
 You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve.
Tomorrow is Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2, which takes things to another level, will be closer to production.
Model 3 order day starting in Australia  
You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.  
Great article by . Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most  
Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model 3  
Tesla charger map  
 being fixed

 Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window.
 no
The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this.  
SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service.
SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory.   
  Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance.
Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks _Satellites for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions.
_Valdric  We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
Evolution hasn't advanced much  
MIT Technology Review 2016  
 checking ...
 exactly :)
Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic  
 Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
 Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
 AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
 Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo.
  yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though.
 Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7.
  That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend.
 Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.  
Next gen Atlas robot

There is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%.
Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude
Just wanted to thank Stu G for   Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
 Don't you already have a spaceship?  
Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs  
Sigh ‚Ä¶  
 Hi :)
 yeah, that's a great one too :)
 Little bit
Worth watching "Nathan for You" on Comedy Central, particularly the "Dumb Starbucks" and "Mechanic/Realtor" episodes
My coffee tastes unusually good this morning  
  yes
Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
  yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer
This baby Model S really is quite fun   
More details on Model 3 unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
 yes
No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
 global
Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
 good point
Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
Love this Tesla video made by  
My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret  
Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
 Interesting name
 I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017
  Thanks Jeff
Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it‚Ä¶  
_penguin _OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.
 Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
 steel collet
Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.  
_Gus probably
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.
Next launch is a  science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.  
Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions  
Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY
Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon.
First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1

_Favreau Thanks Jon!
11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!
Background on the launch  
Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the   webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
Meant to reply to this article:  
This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday.
Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence ‚Ä¶
Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
About 2 mins from static fire
 holding for issue resolution
Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
5 mins from static fire test
 yes, from 70F to 20 F
 It worked in Texas
 -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
  Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.

 Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
 Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change  
About to give a talk at the Sorbonne  
_AA_Carmack Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!
But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15   And Burt Rutan for commercial  
Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.  
 Not quite "rarest". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago &amp; is still around.  
 The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.
It is, however, important to clear up the difference between "space" and "orbit", as described well by  
Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
 Sounds perfect, you had me at "enterprise".
 Yeah and hell yeah
 From anywhere
Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com.
 definitely aliens!
 Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
  well done!
_AA_Carmack noted
 Wow, that's great!
Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves 2.6 sec 0-60 mph and 10.9 sec 1/4 mile in Motor Trend test  
 yes, comes with each car
Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit
I should clarify that   is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
Cool!  
 Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time.
 Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term.
 Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months.
 Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
 We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here.
Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
 important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide
 Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!
Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)
 all
 Hoping for Friday release
 Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
 already in Jordan. Rest of states in region next year.
 thanks Bonnie :)
 planning to have a big opening in Mexico City soon and then proceed gradually to central and South America.
 me too:
 yay! Always happy to make others happy
 big UI update coming in V7.1
 we won't be, but yes
Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important, CR says 97% of owners expect their next car to be a Tesla (the acid test).
Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
 already there
Congrats on driving a Tesla from LA to NY in just over two days!  
Autopilot release to Europe and Asia pending regulatory approval. Hopefully get the ok in the next few weeks.

Some exciting news this week: Tesla Version 7 software with Autopilot goes to wide release on Thursday!
CH4 rapidly decays back to CO2 &amp; is absorbed by plants. What matters is adding new carbon to surface cycle from underground oil, gas &amp; coal.
 Intentions are good, but massively overweights CH4's effect on climate.

Regarding the watch, Jony &amp; his team created a beautiful design, but the functionality isn't compelling yet. By version 3, it will be.
Yo, I don't hate Apple. It's a great company with a lot of talented people. I love their products and I'm glad they're doing an EV.
Peak temp increases due to climate change  
Mostly accurate and fun movie about Mars. Worth seeing.  
_p you can mount a rack to the roof via suction cups and still have one Falcon door work fine. Guaranteed up to 140 mph.
  door is larger than opening and acts as an umbrella. Upper interior trim has hydrophobic coating.
  Front doors have a short arc and their interior panels are chamfered back
Model X Bioweapon Defense Mode definitely filters viruses btw, even the small ones. Has hospital operating room level filtering.

First production cars will be handed over on Sept 29 at our Fremont factory
 Definitely
 Lithium deal is not exclusive &amp; has many contingencies. The press on this matter is unwarranted.
 $35k price, unveil in March, preorders start then.
Model 3, our smaller and lower cost sedan will start production in about 2 years. Fully operational Gigafactory needed.
With same options, Model X is $5k more than an S due to greater size &amp; body complexity. Sig Series is fully loaded, hence high price.
 I appreciate the kind words in the article, but, judging by the picture mods, it looks your Photoshop bill was very high.
True, but achieving a long range affordable electric vehicle has always been our long-term goal. Due in late 2017!

 New Roadster battery should complete safety validation by end of July, so likely available in August
  Wow!
While the rocket does look rather tall &amp; tippy, a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response  
Cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve response. Next attempt in 2 months.
 I only invest in companies I help found or to help a friend or a cause (no return expected for latter two)
Droneship is fine. No hull breach and repairs are minor. Impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion.

Ok, looks like we got some killer footage from the chase plane. Big ocean, small ship. Posting vid shortly  
Looks like Falcon landed fine, but excess lateral velocity caused it to tip over post landing  
Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.
3 mins to liftoff
Launch window always tight when orbital synch needed. In this case, Space Station. For Earth-Sun gravity null point, moon was in the way.
Launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud
Odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than 50%. The 80% figure by end of year is only bcs many launches ahead.

Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise, having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever.
Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head
Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater, noisy, grounded in bad weather
Contrary to press reports, I'm not against flying cars. Just said it was important to consider both pros and cons.

Thanks to everyone that supported Tesla in New Jersey! We couldn't have done it without you.  
However, when self-driving cars become safer than human-driven cars, the public may outlaw the latter. Hopefully not.
To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully, that is obvious.
Battery pack swap is active between SF and LA and seems to be working well. Supercharging is the future, though, for non-commercial traffic.
Neither I nor the company are selling shares. Even if we were, I wouldn't do this. It would be wrong. Our long term results are what matter.

Great DragTimes video of people experiencing P85D "Insane Mode" acceleration for the first time  
Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.
And pls don't ask me about space elevators  until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge

Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.
Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...
Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho.

_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon
The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger:  
_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.
Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for "x-wing" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.
Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel &amp; rocket flyback in future.

 The writer of this article had a problem with his 12V battery, so main pack was constantly charging it.
 Doesn't sound right. If it is, we certainly need to fix it. Investigating...
German govt reviews Tesla Model S fires. All due to high speed impacts, no injuries. Concludes: no defects, no recall  
All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.
The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower &amp; weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
 Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

Model S Owner drives 3121 miles solo from Canada to Mexico  
Good description of the launch by :  
Don't actually mean to knock Honda -- their cars are solid -- but the park outside (or yr house might burn down) advice was awesome
 Model S can seat 5 adults, two kids and has a front trunk for luggage. Might work for you.
...but only if you like your house "Honda recalls Fit for fire risk, says park it outside   "
Saw pressure fluctuations on Falcon boost stage liquid oxygen tank. Want to be super careful, so pushing launch to Thurs.
At Disney World w kids for traditional prelaunch visit (first good flight was after riding Space Mountain)
Launch can be viewed live from Cape causeways or via   webcast around 5:30 local time on Monday
 Easier to make the plane change to equatorial orbit. Done in order to reduce satellite side delta V from 1800 m/s to 1500 m/s.
Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to 80,000 km altitude (~1/4 way to moon).
Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first  geostationary satellite launch.
Tesla Model S Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey highest of any car on road at 99/100  
Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
Why does a Tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than 100,000 gas car fires that kill 100s of people per year?

Will post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures &amp; then immediately printing it in titanium
And, uhh no (zillionth person who asked), I am not going to make an IM suit, however design by hand-manipulated hologram is actually useful.
 Reality is the best illusion
We figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air (seriously). Now need a high frame rate holograph generator.

Tesla pack swap vid still being edited (multiple camera angles). In meantime, this article contains a vid  
Tomorrow night: fastest gas pump in LA vs Tesla battery pack swap  
Partial recall of Model S  
Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars, past and present. It was always there.
 Shai actually got the idea from a visit to Tesla. The idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap), but the technology is not.
Video of battery pack swap will be posted to the Tesla website around 9:30pm, so those attending will see this first.
Live pack swap demo on Thurs night at 8pm California time at our design studio in Hawthorne. Seeing is believing.
Battery storage of solar power needed for night operation &amp; to buffer grid during day. Beta projects are going well.

1st long duration firing of the new generation Falcon 9 rocket ~1.5 million pounds of vac thrust  
 True
We need more women in aerospace like Gwynne!   
Easier said than done. There is a lot of pressure from investors. It is hard not to feel super bad if u don't make ur qtr.
Mars requires developing complex technology over a decade+, but market cares about next 3 months. Result would be conflicting priorities.
 I don't have a publicist
No near term plans to IPO . Only possible in very long term when Mars Colonial Transporter is flying regularly.
Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
Love this image of Dragon docked to the Space Station as it orbits through dark side of Earth  
Vac thrust of 700 tons means avg of 14 tons/floor of structural steel for a 50 story building.
 50% higher. ~1.3 M lbs sea level and ~1.5 M lbs vacuum thrust. Will be 60% higher with some tweaks.
1st firing of Falcon 9-R advanced prototype rocket. Over 1M lbs thrust, enough to lift skyscraper  
Huge expansion of Tesla Supercharger network underway. Will cover LA to NY by end of year  
Bloomberg TV features debate of  vs some guy picking his nose

You Can Fit A Lot Of Kindergartners In A Tesla Model S - Houston Chronicle  
Am thinking of doing a movie "sequel" of sorts to Thank You for Smoking. That was bad CO2 for indiv, this for the planet
Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change  
Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone.
Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy
Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere.
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
 Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round  
Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety
  Exactly
In reality, 97% of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change  
Climate change deniers claim "scientists disagree", same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades
Good article on "Climate Change" vs "Global Warming" referred by   
Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix.
Had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. Probably shouldn't be tweeting :)
Sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside
 Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque.
Technically, I "got rich" from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla &amp; SolarCity.
If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds.
 Carbon produced by a  rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt.
Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
 The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad.
Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (), who lives in NC  
_ Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
 Making rockets
 Don't like having a zillion tweets in the log. Makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history.
 We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't.
And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?
Those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong  
More importantly,  failed to pay back $1.3B. Apart those 2 points, you were totally 1st  
As many have already noted,  is a division of Fiat, an Italian company. We specifically said first *US* company.
Interview with  about Tesla and DOE loan gets into some of the details

 Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change
Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon &amp; Peter Rive &amp; their awesome team. I'm just a small part.
  Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
 It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...
 Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something.
 It can dig up almost anything.
 Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately.
  Given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story  
 Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote &amp; others and streams over 3G (will be LTE later)
 People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way.
Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python.
Hold down voice button &amp; say "Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic". Model S can play almost any song via Internet.
 Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.
There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
 Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
 Stay tuned
Just want to say thanks to customers &amp; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you.

_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system.
Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
 Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners.
Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry  
 Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
 We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway.
 Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better.
_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy
_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
 We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
 High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
F9R (pronounced F-niner) shows a little leg. Design is a nested, telescoping piston w A frame.  
 This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part 4 yet.
Time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). Tesla announcement tomorrow.
 We're aiming for late 2015, but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same

. Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride
. $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.

 @_chrissimmons Exactly. Then no need for clean energy subsidies, as externality is priced into mkt behavior
@_ChrisSimmons A carbon tax would affect coal even more than gasoline, so electricity would also become more expensive
One often hears that there is no point in a US carbon tax unless China acts. Well, they just did  
Rocket static fire  Cape Canaveral launch pad looks good. Engines generated 433 tons of thrust, parameters nominal.
 Best is winning competitions like Formula SAE, design/build/fly or other evidence of exceptional eng ability
 Cool! Btw, thought you might appreciate that 1st flight of Dragon spacecraft carried a large wheel of cheese :)
Thanks ! ‚Äú: The Model S delivered what  promised. A ride to make you re-think going electric.‚Äù

Testing the Model S on a surface of pure ice and snow  
Btw, more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge, v high speed trip &amp; long detours, like NYTimes drive.
 Yeah, Top Gear pretended the Tesla Roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. Logs showed 50 miles range left.
 Thanks Tom! Support of real Tesla customers like yourself who drive the car every day is v much appreciated.
Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers, but after Top Gear BS, we always keep it on for media.
Tesla blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on Broder's NYTimes "range test". Also lining up other journalists to do same drive.
NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max &amp; took a long detour.

To be super clear, I don't wish to (nor could I) mandate anything about a Mars Colony. Am just working on the tech to get people there.
Also, I am not the kale eating overlord of Mars (altho kale has its moments)  
Nice story about a Model S coast to coast road trip. By end of year, it will be Superchargers all the way!  
This gives a sense of what Mars would look like after changing the climate to sustain life  
Death Valley restored to position of world's hottest place

Can't put my finger on it, but for some reason the newsstand is looking particularly good right now  
But if humanity wishes to become a multi-planet species, then we must figure out how to move millions of people to Mars.
And, yes, I do in fact know that this sounds crazy. That is not lost on me. Nor I do think SpaceX will do this alone.
Millions of people needed for Mars colony, so 80k+ would just be the number moving to Mars per year

Good assessment of the Dark Knight Rises in the Atlantic. Dickens, not Rand.  
 Model S starts at $50k after federal rebate. Gen3 will be ~$30k. Need to optimize design and scale volume.
Goal for Model S is to show that electric is way way better than gas. Combine w solar power &amp; the future looks bright.
Worth noting that Muller's research confirming global warming is real was funded by Koch. Fate loves irony.

Simulations show launch ok with bad valve. Still, better to stop &amp; fix. Recalling rockets after launch is not an option.
Launch aborted: slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine 5. Will adjust limits for countdown in a few days.
Whatever happens today, we could not have done it without , but errors are ours alone and me most of all.
