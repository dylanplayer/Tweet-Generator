tweet going lot of work for an extra secs of hopefully will happen this decade true i am accumulating resources to help make life extend the light of consciousness to the stars when vast amounts of manufacturing are as in this slows down rate of so maybe more like still not trying to just being as literal as possible but not quite how i would tell the but it‚Äôs probably worth a read this is important hard to believe that was years ! sigh _ i actually ate the sandwich music in zero gravity given significant architectural including fundamental improvements to pure there is limited value to testing hoping to upload button next an orbital propellant depot optimized for cryogenic storage probably makes sense –∏ the we could talk about the universe and everything coming as you can i have a long history with using what would you like to talk üíØ floor is elevator is waiting on glass the high bay is measured to we will need launch tower for hook height for the lift is m both booster ship need to be stabilized at stage separation booster 1 is a production figuring out how to build transport meter tall booster 2 will first super heavy booster sometimes it‚Äôs about doge the simulation really struggled to make this look real acerbic alliteration bullshit baffles brains that‚Äôs our goal almost ready to fly doesn‚Äôt feel quite right selling will doge selling this song about as an yes did rest of world payload to orbit last probably to this year i love it makes my heart this is good play your favorite song in a turn the volume to you will you will we will support as best we can fly my fly a puckish rogue this is an opportunity for to outdo what has become absolutely clear is that the plethora of corner cases can only be solved with optical this is how humans designed the road system to once you have that in silicon everything else is just icing on the falcon flies for the time tonight it sees in all directions simultaneously getting a homo sapiens loves raves technology why are you so they ask origin of doge day the ancient sacrificed a at the beginning of the doge days to appease the rage of believing that the star was the cause of the sultry doge day afternoon battle for the moral high ground in this new üé∂ this magic moment üé∂ yes for sure wise for elderly or to take the some debate about the second jab quite a few negative reactions to beta has now been expanded to owners we‚Äôve also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the no accidents to next significant release will be in going with pure vision ‚Äî not even using this is the way to absolutely both do mining use blocks chains is an anagram of boring what a quarks leptons green flame in this context means engine is burning internal components made of this is usually followed by a unscheduled transparent aluminum might be cool celebrating a year of great work by the . like , but if manifest is will do of total earth payload to orbit with a single is designed to do in a day what all rockets on earth currently do in a even will take years to build a city on yes falcon 9 is almost always at max when it has it flies back to which costs much less than using a our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit last launched roughly double payload mass of rest of fuel cells should be called fool such a silly choice for not great even for a rocket upper stage but at least not i was just up elevator on the other floor is glass coming we talked about that could just have it land on a big net or bouncy lacks but would optimized landing propellant is only of dry so it‚Äôs not a might just catch the ship with the launch same as booster battery energy density is the key to electric autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time modern airliners are very close to there were but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above something similar happened on an early falcon 1 resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine fair if pressurization had been bubbles would most likely have reverted to helium in header was used to prevent collapse from which happened in prior my fault for sounded good at the engine was low on thrust due to partial helium ingestion from fuel header impact of crushed legs part of multiple fixes in work for we will ask the regulators build of should be done testing by end of next so that‚Äôs roughly when download button should show up assuming user approves warning agrees to drive it will download latest build as soon as car connects to cabs should be able to drive themselves when you‚Äôre in them be electric by it until you make it not connecting cars to as our terminal is much too this is for large trucks it‚Äôs all hot air in the end still many fine details to but the final product will be there‚Äôs nothing else even so much dignity is ascribed to efficiency of the yes great too bad they broke up update probably in will be built at so focus right now is on getting that beast the is mostly good as the people get to choose how the money is but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole it is obviously characterized should be very many subtle differences between us so harder than it the computer started shipping in volume in cars should all have whether or not ordered as an availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays internal development word is used to reduce complacency in usage set expectations all software is first tested internally by simulation drive due to high levels of demand for adding button to service section of car display in days doge spelled backwards is beta has literally will take time to internally before release probably in two or three this was way past leg they got squashed if you want the full beta downloaded to your let us doubling beta program size now with probably size with still be but it‚Äôs getting is an old timer who has seen a lot of thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at hence hard we‚Äôve never seen this next min two engines all the way to the ground restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have was super fun or is this just üôÑ is in now of mars both hardware is deeply underestimated ford are the only carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of of car prototypes are production is hard being cash flow positive is team is doing great one the true measure of success will be that flights are rip honorable discharge landed in one launch abort on slightly conservative high thrust increasing thrust limit recycling propellant for another flight attempt 5 to test flight attempt march launch window opens at beta will be offered much more widely when version 9 is hopefully next month beta build normally drives me around with no next version is a big step change beyond is solving a major part of this is not widely you‚Äôre welcome good point let‚Äôs figure this out all for exciting video but we also can‚Äôt have the place festooned with first heard of we‚Äôll fix the a fan of indeed it was sounds about but we want to be very careful with this transition period there was still a surprisingly high usage of horses in but the trend was obvious _ space from thence to and hence the an area much larger than very much so its leader shall be the doge creating the city of cool yup horses are even scammers should get a room is dumb buying will still be a better deal than subscription for sure green eggs looks familiar the right congrats to rocket china team doge meme shield new drug coming out called pop one all regrets are always wondered where exactly your gaming character keeps all the stuff ahem do androids dream of electric nothing if not discreet hey babe üòâ üôè we will use a catapult air mattresses to land on the then base jump off nickel is our biggest concern for scaling cell that‚Äôs why we are shifting standard range cars to an iron plenty of iron absolutely shut down for two days restarted yesterday this is not about winning anyone we are the reason we are making our own cells is to max production of even moving at full they cannot build enough i hope they it would be awesome prices in the us all don‚Äôt include but it‚Äôs usually included in other then there‚Äôs import duty transport the intent is that revenue to is roughly similar in all so tariffs transport make up the of full hard or stainless is bulletproof to a or not a i mean actual books both i admit to judging books by their cover to the moon sounds like a good idea out on launch engine swap underway probably mid but is really meant for those who are least bay usually has great you might see much higher download speeds on at testing system rockets are ridiculously hard _ i love dogs memes on the actual moon literally potentially many steps some steps we do a lot of before releasing a beta they will fly there from our launch stationed around the seems likely we‚Äôre upgrading all to surround using on focal areas equal compute on all many other so more time needed to write validate maybe something next this is evolving into solving a big part of physical world interesting one of them may be in limited operation by end of year one of the engines is so we‚Äôre swapping it out delivered propellant is reaction to convert + + using wind solar just a surface detail i hope we don‚Äôt go bankrupt building üçÜ super cool we have too much product complexity already _ later this year _ later this year it is still available off but i don‚Äôt think the in many drive yet meets the standard of excellence the solar roof is slightly so snow or ice slide off easily final design is was just in the studio most of earth by end of all by next then it‚Äôs about important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban satellites are best for low to medium population density speed will double to latency will drop to later this year of spaceflight 4 doge good chance of flying this should why don‚Äôt we have these explained or did they say pegged to the something like that heard a rumor some coin was pegging the dollar machine learning is so just some used rigs bought off not really but it was a fun family most people have no even though there are so many progress videos understood right there will be a gap before the next but then it will be a step change is solving a major i just set up some little doge mining rigs with my it was that do seem high an email saying you have gold is not the same as having you might as well have money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of that like all is subject to latency the system will evolve to that which minimizes avocado toast i just want to start a flame in your heart just for a day a hash text file using ancient can be exchanged for real goods to be i am an i am an i don‚Äôt even own any publicly traded stock besides when fiat currency has negative real only a fool wouldn‚Äôt look bitcoin is almost as as fiat the

no power in there will definitely be a sounds like it is active fairing half recovered team is helping save the turtles disturbing concentration only if necessary absolutely i will literally pay actual $ if they just void their accounts yup temporarily raise an acceptable doge is much more if major holders sell most of their it will get my full too much concentration is the only real issue success on landing probability is this time —Å would you like join me for a conversation on meme juice for the weekend good we‚Äôre working on lowering min throttle of so that there is engine redundancy throughout the landing banks are basically heterogeneous databases with high latency weak especially transfers credit a know a thing or two about payments an alien ray tracing on cyberpunk

that you get to hang out with - the future currency of earth just a scratch much üñ§ destiny was essential that the ship landing burn has a clear my greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid full without which we shall forever be confined to _ will still use hot gas maneuvering as more efficient than nitrogen sec vs sec higher too it would seem but raptors have much higher thrust propellant mass fraction than gas they‚Äôre already there yes it‚Äôs by engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are but engines have a min throttle point where there is so landing on 3 engines means high away from hover which is also risky _ yes it was foolish of us not to start 3 engines immediately shut down as 2 are needed to land i am become destroyer of shorts might actually happen sandstorm is a masterpiece we were too dumb next we try pull method no no only doge no need to be a to own is the people‚Äôs welcome the most entertaining outcome is the most likely doge high seas wind this was a tough one off twitter for a while it will be filled with graffiti art progress is working super hard to ensure implant safety is in close communication with the if things go we might be able to do initial human trials later this if you‚Äôve worked on advanced phones or those skills are needed feels weird helping make good version cyberpunk come true please consider working at solve injuries symbiosis latter will be important work at either at our bay area or locations on clubhouse tonight at la time tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed before that is not recommended he became a big fan of but was not pushing it that came from me reading about soviet methane engine tests that got over at that a methane stage gets slightly better than a hydrogen that sounds tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those dean too for kestrel tom is great was instrumental in developing early versions of but not later versions of or will be so it will accelerate unusually high is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of the primary for expendable throwing away stages is the primary so optimization is low no escaping that for me read the whole article sunny day snowy mountains what a beautiful day in la _ i never used this he gave a talk at only halo i sure hope that‚Äôs not true at

sell cars u don‚Äôt own but u sell stock u don‚Äôt this is ‚Äì shorting is a scam legal only for vestigial reasons yes finishing engineering this production starts next aiming to have release candidate design late drive system advanced battery work were important i made that absolutely unlike its aircraft which is the space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government under those humanity will never get to nomad ü§ó the of cyberpunk are incredible the interior design major improvements coming a little new roadster is part rocket there‚Äôs more storage now easily yes probably in a few months after you drive without using a for a few it gets very annoying to go back use a no more car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it context you can override on a hedge fund that shorts is a shrubbery also a rear screen 0 to trap speed in a top speed right first production car ever to achieve 0 to mph in less than 2 seconds it can play cyberpunk plaid model s ships next month even discord has gone wild times on discord waiting for review passed initial pressure test yes bought a hand knit wool the martian helm for my dog i kinda love it does not serve the public to hamstring today for an amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation we‚Äôre hoping for approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon the entire from data collection through labeling inference has to be in surround this is a hard this does not require a hardware change to cars in although it will be crazy not to turn on is steadily moving all to 8 camera surround this will enable superhuman the road to hell is mostly paved with bad all launched next year will have laser only our polar have lasers this year are yup i hope so these also have laser links between the so no ground stations are needed over the poles sorry for the version is what it should say for separate version number for rest of to my has better hardware software than it floats opening party for loop happening as soon as under in tunnel yesterday with my boys lasers üíØ we‚Äôre switching to a more sensible version numbering to distinguish between major minor current build is it drove me to an unfamiliar location in la back last night with no early next week given so many other companies are depending on this it is getting even more scrutiny than a flight launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers excited about offering access to orbit for small they are part of the but require lots of fresh water we may need something that‚Äôs scale industrial in to for by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy it‚Äôs a good path for fully renewable rocket so solves part of but longer chain hydrocarbons than are needed to be solid at room temp details next week am donating towards a prize for best carbon capture technology _ pretty much that would probably mean civilization is doing although depends on assumptions for inflation he‚Äôs everywhere they üñ§ the part or process in cell production is constantly changing cars trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases but road tunnels under would solve traffic be an example to the spoke with about tunnels last if governor mayor want this we will do _ with our giant casting we are literally trying to make cars in the same way that toy cars are made is an exceptionally smart good human _ the best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume like food some medical toys battery cell production is the fundamental slowing down a sustainable energy very important looking into no question that should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a for sure glad you‚Äôre this is a good one i whistle doesn‚Äôt need a garage it will be awesome good point your code is doing too much happy birthday so glad you guess you been watching cobra fallout new only chuck can divide by zero good point the thing we call money is just an information system for labor what actually matters is making goods providing we should look at currencies from an information theory whichever has least error latency will python is amazing they sure can twist the knife in that probably wise we‚Äôre making major improvements to ease of engine needs to be a few hours at two of the engines need slight so will be switched out nice shot we don‚Äôt have high school but please apply when you‚Äôre in prototypes are volume production is positive cash flow is excruciating physics inspections good progress towards our in go to all three static fires completed no a lot has happened in fair enough sea shanty takes it to a new level with actual pirate ships sure today at is about practicing engine ship is held down by massive pins while engines are two starts about to try a as promised legalize comedy you can steal our we probably won‚Äôt sue you we‚Äôre just trying to get people to help would be one we will get a camera up there that also shows the star field in the background suicide is more than double homicide absolutely hey you yeah you queen you‚Äôre gonna make hate to say but might be true the robot future is coming every but there are times i wish it were faster mus üë∂ this is an important distinction much more than this increasing rapidly it is once in a something happens that is even better than we imagined the factory is the product probably commenting on will do more i bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for they‚Äôre great places to get spare a lot of people are going to be super unhappy with west coast high tech as the arbiter of free speech already donated to signal a year will donate i am primarily trying to advance two sustainable energy extending beyond there is also the existential threat of which we should aspire to this doesn‚Äôt leave time to write maybe a day later this year the prancing üò¢ it‚Äôs true but not for long they seemed optimistic too my said he feels like will be a good i let us all make it was also thinking that should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time i super support public spaces around our production launch wherever it can be done safely and when we will open up our restaurant to the public figure out ways to allow limited access to the high that too catapult high into the air land on the roof with a base jumping parachute only way to that‚Äôs actually our but is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with degree windows a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory and increase me neither one of the best solar roof installations but maybe one day that would be the best way to do a large solar field or reactor is needed for and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the these are probably the trickier his sick beats probably less than a few dozen primary only or at least the option for so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts launch underway critical feedback is always super as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference harder than it yup an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert this will be needed on mars even for early missions earth too over not to get to in photon emission powered by annihilation would but that‚Äôs more of a this will be hard to as it isn‚Äôt like any other vehicle playing the long game true i hope wings don‚Äôt work on the moon at all and def not well on no have the potential of and a back to work how strange use signal ya don‚Äôt reminds me of this timeless classic fast water with tiny rocks and then razor is actually third most likely as seen from an external not the participants the most entertaining outcome is the most likely dumb and dumber is a great movie tho this is called the domino effect doesn‚Äôt quite illustrate true size payload volume mass are that of because of the large it may seem but actually ranges up to 5 stories tall snow falling on yes üòâ is responsible for of all the personal professional pain in my life but it was worth so proud of the team for achieving this major at the start of i thought we had a chance of surviving at we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance full will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this of that i am can‚Äôt speak for regulators isn‚Äôt but will make it isn‚Äôt enough to be safer than human autopilot ultimately needs to be more

a few lumps along the way production is prototypes are building to create a city on mars is our exactly will press header tank with solution is under not clear what is yes legs would certainly but best part is no best step is no step yes saves mass cost of legs enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount ‚Äî ready to in under an hour we‚Äôre going to try to catch the super heavy booster with the launch tower using the grid fins to take the load dog had my undivided attention until ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant seems odd that the opposition group is from home state of very far from where is building the and why would a group that claims to be oppose a sustainable energy aren‚Äôt there more important this is very opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress literally are we sure this is destiny no escaping that for me all cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the full option for delivery docs must be fully complete by midnight and mark this action is not the last kingdom show is great will be text but could add voice even cheese is made of cake if they don‚Äôt love we‚Äôre in deep not everything is made of cake true such a weird game when you think about it this is not we need a overhaul these are just incremental improvements to the production build is a fundamental not just in the but also our

instead of engaging in corporate power this is the good roughly of parts in roadster were unique ‚Äî not in any other since we started out with the in goal of simply adapting lotus to we ended up with a too small sports car that seems kinda like a yes very important service might be able to do will you mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don‚Äôt have but definitely this year good point interesting has always done great interviews falcon was of successful orbital launches in but maybe a majority of payload to anyone done the vaccines are just the it‚Äôs also capable in theory of curing almost turns medicine into a software simulation yes we will offer multiple display options a few more revisions probably beta or sure there are differences between us traffic but beta will be extended to very soon yes we need a other traffic setting definitely it‚Äôs a step in that direction it‚Äôs one üî• or üî• if you don‚Äôt have a car with pedestrian we couldn‚Äôt get everything done in but more stuff the writing on cobra is i will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts you can upload custom pedestrian speaker is otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn change your horn sound to üí® or holiday jingles with latest software merry happy üéÅ great it will most likely make sense for to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable design general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind are the fundamental limitation on doing capital allocation is but low public company duties are a much bigger but going private is impossible now yes a few months coming soon minor yeah story rocket turns off its engines does a controlled fall we‚Äôre just ironing out a few bugs to owners taking delivery in the final days of your support is super what could possibly go good idea during the darkest days of the model 3 i reached out to cook to discuss the possibility of apple acquiring of our current he refused to take the if - already uses for medium range cars made in our shanghai - a is as max voltage is too maybe they meant cells bonded like our structural battery reply to hi thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make my heart goes out to indeed it was a seriously twisted but all‚Äôs that ends they although it‚Äôs kind superchargers are being made accessible to other electric are such large transactions even i love all u crazy out there you have a point great game pretty the main value of college used to be hanging having pseudo intellectual conversations partying with people your own even that‚Äôs come for the stay for the we will release subscription early next one doge bitcoin is almost as as fiat money great nails lipstick nice sounds about right edge nice branding just who needs a safe word bitcoin is my safe word standing down for today to inspect hopefully launching pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen review i am hoping to be back next very impressive mission by last launch of coming up he was indeed quite but we did not actually know what we were so he had a point it will get absurdly engineering is there‚Äôs some great out but can it while playing cyberpunk ? star star bright this is incorrect but it is visually stunning is good a being better armor than a chest plate doesn‚Äôt make sense in the absence of wish there weren‚Äôt item limits in a oh and i absolutely support but all these pronouns are an nightmare the raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude as we hit min throttle an engine would shut far from fully but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy with three engines it‚Äôs a good to great game but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great perhaps slightly more but it‚Äôs essential to view this as output vs as with all especially new output will follow an very slow at but increasing then then sure hope that future doesn‚Äôt come to will be the first to use our new structural pack most advanced made both front rear body castings advanced paint with so much new production timing is naturally harder to original ex was human revolution was also great the objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old this is a much more serious . ascent to the heavens ü§£ seems pretty i picked so start was a little but picks up seemed like almost everyone on steam was playing cyberpunk at some point this void i still have a soft spot in my heart for transpiration in it would use more mass than a tile but that remains to be ship leeward side will be bare windward will have hexagonal heat shield tiles yes should be preserved in memory of did even reaching apogee would‚Äôve been so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was thank south for your this is the gateway to the universe and everything engines did here we fuel header tank pressure was low during landing causing touchdown velocity to be high but we got all the data we congrats team hell successful switchover to header tanks precise flap control to landing ü§† space is the fastest way to travel long distance on it‚Äôs called the space but it‚Äôs actually moving around earth at times the speed of sound or times faster than a rifle bullet and thanks for the - alien message probably chance of completing all mission objectives hopefully flying tomorrow yup out on the pad in south station looks singing carrying even more symbiotic bacteria than cells _ yes we are mobile cell colonies it and no toilet paper watch demolition man unbound not bad it was a beast compared to the award accepted on behalf of the great people at boring co much of what people think of an science is actually no such thing as a only rocket latter is who put humans on the science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the engineering is about creating things that never existed it does get a bit cold at night paint makes a hell of a difference thanks for everything you did to help build some of the best memories it will be real soon legs are one of the hardest externally mounted legs require which adds wider stance adds shock add that we need better static fire is not risky from build but we need to clear the build site for early flights just a static fire flight no earlier than it will have landing legs very sad tony was for a second i thought that was a pic of truncate zeros then round probably going to a wider beta in weeks with least important digits truncated it feels like is what we‚Äôre betting on for training with for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great but happy hopefully next month overall air suspension height damping algorithm is getting a lot of will be linked to so acts true the promise is greatly needed we will have special colors for new as we did for the original . is savage if you ever wondered where we came from this is a life leader so more risk than normal but only slightly filled this is a subject of much debate major upgrades are slated for many small but overall wiring is more engines are more nosecone is sealed but that‚Äôs why we have 9 lot of things need to go so maybe chance good static aiming for first / ft altitude flight next goals are to test 3 engine body transition from main to header tanks landing maybe start on that a year from depends on how progress not yet not we will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all but it‚Äôs probably smarter than a whole new shorter external rapid complete rocket low cost orbital refilling propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life yes we‚Äôre still far from simply video control the biggest currently underway at is high fps video for training beta 5 coming out in a few improvement should be exciting wow yea tomorrow will be the flight of this landing on of course i still love you sure true we have quiet a queue of products to better do new roadster at some fate loves but hates hypocrisy yes üòÉ our data center was named as a joke over years might have been tempting is a vehicle for creating producing many useful products largest cast titanium part in the no heat shielding landing at in off to the side it doesn‚Äôt take out the launch mount in bad but with the same arm used to pick up the ship where it should because i am not an is definitely not the only good but investing is not what i but i always put my own money into companies i help otherwise it‚Äôd be wrong to ask others to do almost anything quite the day ahead now is what you‚Äôd call cool they‚Äôre moving at times the speed of but it feels like nothing there will always be upgrades it will be better than human vision by quite a margin reality looks like a strange at radar almost everything except metal is exactly this is a developed continues to use for dragon docking with just pointless for if you‚Äôre going to do active photon use an occlusion penetrating like precision radar at one day we will fly you on well i can‚Äôt comment on internal but you‚Äôre roughly in the rocket especially if are insanely the hardest problem known to to be this was just an other companies in china have not done is but it should be said that we have a very talented team at too much credit comes to me they stole apple‚Äôs code they have an old version of our software don‚Äôt have our inference computer wild . yup change out a few otherwise fine caution strongly advised with sure sexy cropping champion of all time if next week‚Äôs release looks we will widen beta there are too many rules around liquor even in the we will be selling the lightning bottle shot glasses next week‚Äôs release is lot of fundamental both important bug fixes entire new areas of years billion wow _ safety is our primary design goal fully let the martians decide their own future a lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both will be too slow to be relevant in our we can establish a human base there in our at least a future civilization ‚Äì discovering our ruins ‚Äì will be impressed humans got that that is certainly the the only publicly traded stock i own is wise words from the point of companies is products they have no point in of nor do these buy hold stock in companies where you love the product sell where you just a mild same with my def had means viral load of million per life in glass domes at to support like yeah i was going to say but that seemed too obvious and cases with high ct should quarantine for a few while getting another second test determines whether they‚Äôre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail where viral fragments but person is not so many things you want some you didn‚Äôt know you wanted

groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in in indeed looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than for more than tons to so it‚Äôs mostly about fixed costs divided by

to say that it simply felt like a mild launch in 5 minutes with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls the same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital as one use obviates the other dragon can also hover land but we use the parachutes for maximum safety are integrated with enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety i feel pretty no symptoms right last i had symptoms of a minor had some brutal but this was mild hopefully doing tests from several different same time of administered by am requesting gene cycle there is no official standard for not sure people realize both insanely too bad they had this pointless argument astronaut launch no kids though hell of a wig collection too it would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results worth reading this thread if you‚Äôre curious about testing they should be if you get a blood pressure they tell you the not just if it‚Äôs there is not a clear consensus on what ct value of what gene constitutes a little up feels just like a regular but more body achy cloudy head than in your at what ct number for the gene should a test probably be regarded as if asking the wrong what is a better ! but please be super expect two steps one lot of new code was just a we can buff it am getting wildly different results from different but most likely i have a moderate case of my symptoms are that of a minor which is no since a is a type of all the way up ahem unless you‚Äôre on laws of you can‚Äôt win you can‚Äôt break even you can‚Äôt stop playing shakes

you‚Äôre probably not infectious above you probably are below sound about this a great worth a case closed soon lab i just spoke to thinks below is to gets dicey above is will talk to several more there must be a graph of amplification cycle vs false positive rate lab i just spoke to said detection below cycles is reliable above cycles is not this is not the spike they don‚Äôt consider that just spoke directly to a testing their main search is for the unique to is also but is generic to other high cycle count give false but they believe accuracy is good below cycles cycles is their strange possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold flu prevalence vs prior if someone comes in with symptoms falsely tests positive for they will assume they have when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal lower the true the higher the false positive number will this sounds but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is from sure is would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the testing what‚Äôs the approximate false positive all things for interesting interesting what is the general population knowledge of accuracy of a test is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough a good test should identify if i have the spike although i have heard some low accuracy numbers for those hard to get a straight false positives will roughly scale with # of tests daily test rate has gone mild sniffles cough slight fever past few right no although i did take i tested then negative then positive so musk tests negative for is an equally correct the antigen from seems to be about as useful as a flipping a the carousel turns ever faster yup exactly symptoms of a typical nothing unusual so if it‚Äôs happening to it‚Äôs happening to getting tests from separate results will take about something extremely bogus is going was tested for four times two tests came back two came back same same same rapid

for a long time ‚Äî from mid to mid production logistics i put in my last even though i thought we would still it was either that or certain death for extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup super quirky back while stalwarts like gm were going that funding round completed on eve in last hour of last day as investors were leaving town that night we were 3 days away from i put in all money i didn‚Äôt own a house had to borrow money from friends to pay difficult yes lowering terminal which may sound rather is actually our most difficult technical challenge as soon as we get regulatory around middle of next right it takes about 5 to set with future probably less than 3 no technical knowledge just point at open sky plug and are next after we get us out of early didn‚Äôt realize that was no problem if there‚Äôs a way get current design approved in as soon as we get country this is required for each country as no approval system probably start receiving final are many approvals around lower latitude states need more satellites in so probably several thousand more beta participation invitations going out this week new design is better with many minor even the small details very close to actual expected i could not be more excited about the new that while it is considerably i don‚Äôt think it necessarily requires all that much incremental _ maybe in a month or so _ it‚Äôs basically a tank from the future that‚Äôs so yeah _ team is making great factory will be an yes penguin random house üò¥ should change the name to random although it might be quite a short lot can go but we‚Äôll provide warts you will see every frame that we this is what matters most we‚Äôve tested a version in a wind tunnel with active closing the loop for so it will probably work at but reality tends to bite you on the ass lord of the if it fails right at the some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the minor understanding exactly how the body flaps control yaw roll during such that the ship is positioned well to flip would be a big win a right off launch pad is also is almost controlled descent with body flaps would be transferring propellant

system turns will definitely be banked in are tunnels safe in an exactly the guides are basically just a a shock a costs a few hundred dollars in it would allow many streets to become parks and walking less more probably only need three straight spiral ramp latter only for tight passive lateral safety is required by regulators i think they‚Äôre might be able to build this into the tunnel wall so long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or there is probably a good safety you‚Äôre we did have a sim but it was so i didn‚Äôt include we‚Äôre working on one that makes things pop park and i know that area best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding if all vehicles were densely seated throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is but better to offer a range of vehicles let people decide what makes them happy a variety of like normal from a small car to a densely seated must be seated belted for high speed next step for loop is demonstrating high throughput at high target is at precisely presentation starting at this affordable mass but better in that it takes you where and when you to go the demo ride takes you in car on down zips through tunnel using guide up elevator at destination then drives on normal roads back to start actually way more way faster way more subways are but it‚Äôs time to

next will also charge much faster supercharger capacity will double by end of next expect to be within range of to of population in all active it‚Äôs got enough load capacity volume to carry the battery pack our current pack energy density is about double that of original it would probably only save about to of all things in order of resource but not necessarily production as that depends on thousands of parts which are extremely difficult to forecast what really matters is time to volume not initial market apart from brief vehicle production is limited by total battery lot on our so it‚Äôs either get van gliders or compute from produce sooner or do all produce not a big difference to total vehicles produced either priority list is model solar roof maybe interesting to work with on an electric that‚Äôs a great we will absolutely agree investigating probably mid can provide for days using battery not but should be possible around major parts supply chain to should be if should be please ask service but perhaps in a few years good we have that state so can push data to phone just like super troopers ideal situation in no is that arrives at scene fast with service loaner will allow having your car picked up dropped off or using mobile rangers service vans if car lift isn‚Äôt needed adding functionality to phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1

did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until we bought some trucking companies secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter probably technically

ethical scientists i know are accused of publishing climate papers for they earn ü•ú vs their other but give that up to help but their accusers make billions by slowing down clean which is more that is true should be right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy but move rapidly towards sustainable means lower profits but will make them stronger we know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel have to use sustainable energy so why not go renewable now avoid increasing risk of climate betting that science is wrong oil companies are right is the dumbest

north tonight not we just bundled the upgrade package into no problem if you want to return the but i think lifetime free supercharging is a good on of followers like even lame on good posts get lacks scale is but def has gems twitter account is because it‚Äôs not real exactly you‚Äôre earlier model 3 performance buyers got free lifetime will add that to anyone who bought on likes are rare criticism is so it‚Äôs glad you‚Äôre s is but rear seat folds down in model so bikes can fit in trunk hey that‚Äôs my good question you‚Äôre not reading my twitter i wish taking body shops now operating in aiming for same day body repair in most yes i would never i am a little not that or a making progress i said dankest not darkest actually cat girl here‚Äôs selfie it‚Äôs pretty hot deep i think frost secretly preferred the latter fire and ice flies like an but fruit flies like a banana love the bound to happen _ yes time love supporters so midnight my twitter feed _ then the hell with not moths tho send me dankest üêª in üß† fresh from my meme dealer there are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one model 3 was car in us by revenue despite no no paid endorsements no competitors spent billions on model 3 was product massive thanks to owners we wouldn‚Äôt be here without same how‚Äôd they around mid there have been hundreds of improvements to fit finish over the but no major step change in this are dramatically better now than in the only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose just did that to correct the front design of model the nose of an electric car shouldn‚Äôt look like a radiator grill get this question a so need to clarify that there‚Äôs no such thing as a other car companies do this every but constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every to simplify many model s x interior will no longer be available after order now to be sure of the one you model 3 body design could def be less most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars working on it that is correct twitter thought i got hacked locked my account wanna buy some and i own a wolverine order without test drive you get 3 days to return for else 1 day former will be in next point release a few months for drive on navigation we need to address differences in how lane lines are varies greatly by good point interesting this is a ~ ft demo first tunnel still set for pending regulatory under la mph | opening event that night free rides for the public next day pretty actually i think real opens the first tunnel is almost done twitter is dark souls of social is is good this game is my personal but i am biased towards space stuff coming soon turn on enhanced security via the settings this will require entering a to use the digital would i really let someone get away with using my name all this is my secret troll it‚Äôs time people bored i will not maybe phone as controller exactly coming yes reality is hard online doesn‚Äôt count coming soon no that‚Äôs next had to been done welcome i hope this is if you don‚Äôt like a for any reason or no you can just give it back for a full refund also available off menu for a was causing too much model 3 long rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so it‚Äôs kind of like the post same price for delivery to as the sf bay but you do get a free factory which is really fun to rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow we did our traction testing on an ice dual motor is but not required for cold just don‚Äôt use it‚Äôs a long range battery with fewer portion of the pack is disproportionately but we can get it done now instead of just released lower model 3 super simple new order page week or two love the comments too dog saves her puppies y you‚Äôll see tomorrow brings a lemur special circumstances yes üòÄ new summon will use the autopilot cameras aiming for next few months but this will improve dramatically over next several months all cars ever produced early will get improvements for free software updates is a big part of why a retains so much value over same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year just reviewed service locations in north realized we have major gaps in geographic sorry for this foolish will aim to cover all regions of just big within 3 to 6 insightful article by thanks really admire you i think you‚Äôre one of the best engineers hope you return to working on rockets one the upgrade is the computer with our chip i believe it‚Äôs months before it is in all new production no change to this is simple replacement of the autopilot will be done free of charge for those who ordered full somewhere between to be actual improvement is significantly overestimated in this vs is more like a increase in useful due to enabling integrated better use of discrete this is without the per my public that will give the car an extra order of still a long way to go model 3 motor gearbox still in good condition after driving designed for ultra high works best if you play games full screen use steering wheel balls for control it is actually my game on cars right now üòÄ what are some of the most fun games we could have on a classic is just the yes thanks for recognizing the great work of the people it is time to create a also love princess love your name maybe this could be part of a car version of go style game üíó good whole beer keg fits in model 3 mechanical logic gates comes with free nothing more useful in the entire maybe wise to bring it just in case üòâ about half my money is intended to help problems on earth half to help establish a city on mars to ensure continuation of life all in case earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or happens we destroy ourselves you should ask why i would want the reason is not what you very little time for don‚Äôt have vacation homes or yachts or anything like yes exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate which affects all species on even if your faith in humanity is this is worth caring support makes a thank visual approximation coming soon glad you‚Äôre safe beautiful picture it‚Äôs hard to not sure a is objectively much safer in a crash than all other according to this is just this is incorrect at falcon on night with the base support of much museum in south bend punctuality is not my strong suit we‚Äôd be nothing without our fans because is obviously louder than üòÄ no such thing as a at or even a model our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for there is no it sure very you are right a reminder of why it‚Äôs important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power you‚Äôre most glad i could be thanks for letting me know about warms my üòÄ the physics of how achieved best safety of any cars ever when vehicle weight is taken into order is more like then but they are all very falcon has landed owner shows how well seats hold up after the black white interior is def best what city what model 3 my character sonic boom this won‚Äôt be two ‚Äî one for üëΩ üëæ millions of years from now and one for you yes but üêª in üß† that we‚Äôre creating a generalized autonomy must work in millions of strange üöò blade runner ‚Äî edition ‚Äî it‚Äôs 1 of 3 forward cameras in rear view mirror external cameras will in future if car is damaged while fair point üòÄ when something sounds too good to be it usually way the trick works is companies like keep up to of short interest but suffer almost none of equity as they‚Äôre just made in short lending last not shorting applied to market as a whole is net negative ‚Äî it negative it stops private companies from going preventing access by retirement funds small thus increasing wealth moving to wide release holding back autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for that works well only if they‚Äôre extremely tiny we don‚Äôt any pic you owners can refer someone to buy a get any image they want laser etched in glass sent to deep space for millions of years rococo basilisk is first falcon 9 land landing mission from air force base in coming up the of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam the big funds can as they‚Äôre suffering a net index managers like pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for index if applied to individual stocks selectively but false if applied broadly to most of the market without clear consent of the shareholder where this breaks down is in passive index which constitute most of the the holders of those mostly small investors retirement don‚Äôt realize that their stocks are being lent to short diminishing their true equity there is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to as it dilutes the shareholder base gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means including regulators i hope to be less wrong over time you‚Äôre most hope to do more to help in the what they do should be illegal the last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned are value should definitely be by taking publicly available selling model 3 actually outsold by a factor of two this is amazing almost we expanded the early access program to more users a few days people sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make so long as it makes great it will have great if you think is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash hang in if you are truly it will be true sorry about the that was why would they be upset about their it‚Äôs what they just want to that the enrichment commission is doing incredible and the name change is so on great verdict üòÄ could be worse üòá autopilot team is got to make sure we iron out the details long tail of tricky edge important to get front wide b pillar side repeater camera neural nets just something especially weird going on with yahoo news feed on stocks almost always super maybe getting naughty by nature üòâ will definitely moving heavily towards direct to delivery of will deliver your car to this is the the way it should that was intense will take and remember huge thank you to all supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the you sorry for difficulties delivering your due to high critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run you‚Äôre sorry for the what would be great is original elite going over final tweaks hopefully in wide release end of owners increased tire pressure improves if you have performance they are better but slightly lower üòÄ we‚Äôre upgrading our logistics but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate tricky one thanks for offering to the coming week is incredibly if any current owners who‚Äôd like to help educate new owners could head to delivery centers during midday on on that would be super probably for a base to be built mars base alpha consider an ice same but much faster with arms in vs arms same principle is true for a front vs rear wheel weight though commonly isn't the right you can have on on rear still have poor handling if mass elements are far from dumbbell mass distribution is spinning is simple explanation of polar moment of inertia other important car terms at key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia of mass around of a to the extent of our is better than any other production this positively affects handling driving extremely important a car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car when it comes to make sure newton is on your side helps improve forward crumple zone especially important in high speed frontal and moments of inertia in side impacts piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details all 5 star are the as the videos just means a car met a certain but injury probability stats tell you by how true . will post final safety probability stats model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever glad they‚Äôre physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality but with room to add more down the kinda have if there is no a simulation probably wouldn‚Äôt spend computing power on sound yes true üòÄ to conserve computing a simulation would only render an object when it is observed you‚Äôre most sorry for the will love space bar there will be thousands and millions of missions anyone will be able to go should be active by then so many moon mission will be in high def so it‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre there in minus a few seconds for speed of light perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to there will be no obligation to do very close üòÄ always yes that‚Äôs the first barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material yeah that‚Äôs exactly how i however it i just hope it thanks for helping fund a rocket spaceship that could take humanity beyond hanging out with before the moon mission announcement will be bringing 8 artists cultural figures with him on the journey around the probably alpha build albeit a beta will improve with good news on this engineering rallied this will be part of going through final testing thank you for your trust in the greatly will be interesting to see how this evolves over time will see what we can really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as it‚Äôs not sustainable very interesting due to some owners encountering system issues the free supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night this is definitely worth thoughtful what might we do differently to improve i do top priority is and will remain supporting crewed spaceflight and national security missions can‚Äôt emphasize enough how would not be where it is today without . thank with lasers my tweet ever if you can help get rid of the annoying scam that would be much appreciated maybe the scammers will just get tired of winning eventually good they are there in the flight but we forgot to put them in this forward moving wing üòâ we‚Äôve gone from production hell to delivery logistics but this problem is far more we‚Äôre making rapid should be solved awesome üòé design has been changed so the üöÄ lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three two of which actuate for pitch it‚Äôs not really sustainable at volume production doesn‚Äôt optimal we probably should have ended this yes that‚Äôs our service parts supply in general will be the top priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few outside repair shops are jack of all which means supporting of makes collision repair specializes in having all parts in stock not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of goal is for repaired car to be better than before should always be true if parts are correctly replaced with newer exciting to see some collision repair operations already completing within aiming for same day then under an is bringing most collision repairs as outside firms take weeks to months for driving owners crazy true owners can grant free supercharging for life to a friend who buys ends tomorrow hi the board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in despite many owes its very existence to this the muskrat is like a beaver with small but it has a certain quiet dignity üòÄ intentionally so electric cars made with sunlight yes bricks will be free if used for affordable housing projects yes first boring brick store opening in only cents a rated for seismic about to finish first building made with boring bricks in the shape of a medieval watchtower . will transport your car all the way into your garage thoughtful feedback due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in north customers may experience longer response resolving this is our top my am working on this exact issue right now best show in the service will stock all colors love that we tried every possible way to make red look without floating a special red tint in primary gloss but no we have to stop whole paint shop for red it looks like an episode of moving 2 of 7 colors off menu on to simplify obsidian black metallic silver will still be available as special but at higher looks cool not easy coming up with a good cover story for an underground volcano but i think it‚Äôs working our new boring machine with a üéÆ is about the right cell but i don‚Äôt recommend copying our current module far too difficult to like sands through the hourglass types of people in the those who understand binary those who don‚Äôt will do as promised not gonna die right here in the or just not on i am a business magnet good times with will add a fade mode with only essential info in august sales will be on at pacific on am running it in my but it‚Äôs not right will release to advanced early access users in a week or then more broadly towards end of much great is why model 3 is the electric despite no advertising or paid the colors white are red as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth complexity we‚Äôve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint quality in if need we‚Äôre entire sections of car or building whole new got to be can please insult me some best pr had in a ! i was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned v cool so you actually did nothing yet imply you are a the twitter name you chose is . answer the question . you brought it not did you investigate or if what did you actually at this i want even if it is a scam did you investigate at guessing answer is it‚Äôs i swear you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strange he hasn‚Äôt sued he was offered free legal and you call yourself great actions by twitter to delete bogus will increase usage by real for the my voice cracked once during the times that‚Äôs there were no sure i want that outfit the world lost a great man in john he was an brave and fundamentally decent human if only there were more such people in the this is why a small company with tight focus high energy can beat a big company without this is utterly fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that for will be renewable powered by end of next most people don‚Äôt realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil checks other service most major customers have tried it love now we need to finish production design build while avoiding dumb mistakes made with model 3 production wish it wasn‚Äôt so hard to be less stupid over time maybe this was key showstopper for me couldn‚Äôt make it even through expert fiduciary without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by current rules have good but make wealth creation harder for small the extension cord was miles but still what‚Äôs cool is that it was driven across the country alone escort or any accompanying using the existing supercharger network and an extension cord in talking to our public most were supportive of optimizing for value creation over quarterly this was also a factor in remaining it‚Äôs almost done yes looks brutal otherwise this is actually real this the vacuum tunnel will be a bit longer will provide some advance funding for student teams with most promising bonus award for all race pods that exceed half the speed of car karaoke hopefully ready in software update version just played missile asteroids lunar lander in really i was just cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught super appreciate fast response by fire no injuries or damage to goal is to service your car wherever you quietly no need to bring it to a service love born in the brain is more than true but it has only flashes of it knows itself too it criticizes itself so far from banishing it is itself reared only upon a structure of red and the so many saved so so dying to if you have suggestions for improvement after you drive it thank you for the thoughtful letter thanks for buying our would highly recommend performance it‚Äôs really good i don‚Äôt say that nothing will give you greater full no hard feelings if coming soon definitely is so yet gives you death by water didn‚Äôt it really makes me wanna buy rice read notes on the waste land version ford are the only 2 car companies to avoid i just got home from the you think this is an it is super appreciate free concert for during this intense great meeting makes great high respect for our hardware needs were just unique matched tightly to our model 3 review by unbox via missile command lunar lander already working in we changed the control mapping for max fun on a defeating traffic is the ultimate boss battle blue too hex nostalgia excited to work with silver lake and as financial plus and as legal on the proposal to take private open to it at some you did an impressive amount of work on this mostly even though i didn‚Äôt do an interview pose for beam good we will add this model 3 traction testing on pure ice snow great last thanks for helping make more planning to vehicle security software for free use by other car extremely important to a safe future for great will be a fun project for love the idea of adding a special item every few so whenever you go into a there is something new delightful to production design will be especially in we are dying to do but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of model 3 bringing y to market he was amazing not if you had a wide elastic at the top busted and thigh high socks with pockets for cards of course paired with what are your short short shorts coming soon to put them on post a selfie awesome ü§£ love this from has got all the and the other all the appearance of reminds me so of my who was very stern strict yet kindest of believe in those are the new design made of doesn‚Äôt need heat shielding or even meant to say same as hardware yes probably 4 to 6 those who order full get the upgrade at no it isn‚Äôt needed just for enhanced deliveries hardware chart by at investor support is only reason why this is not certain is that it‚Äôs contingent on a shareholder def no forced hope all shareholders will be way smoother less disruptive as a private ends negative propaganda from but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so no change shareholders could either to sell at or hold shares go private am super appreciative of will ensure their prosperity in any my hope is current investors remain with even if we‚Äôre would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with already do this with fidelity‚Äôs yes i don‚Äôt have a controlling vote now wouldn‚Äôt expect any shareholder to have one if we go i won‚Äôt be selling in either good morning üòÄ am considering taking private at funding maybe great work by . need the neural interface soon to enable we‚Äôre working on a new that can squeeze in an adult yes model s is def still the top but model 3 performance is higher value for money early access will have bugs but you never know for so would not advise early access unless you‚Äôre prepared to have something go wrong üñ§ autopilot team üñ§ everywhere much more interesting games other refinements will go to all x 3 from start of autopilot enhancements apply to all model plus s x made in last few years autopilot hardware or glad you‚Äôre enjoying model 3 thanks for buying a major enhancements to autopilot fun games coming in a month with yup def worth model 3 performance is üñ§ before i knew i was writing to the guardian thanks for the his attention to detail is the humans love the director also made original very tiny performance model 3 review by turns out even was shorting stock still as true today as it was 6 years ago squirrels will work with current definitely is amazing something like but more of an adults in cars anime vibe please send examples of prior work when looking for max if you‚Äôre into video game consider applying to we want to make super fun games that integrate the center touch phone car üòõ cool good idea thanks for supercharger trophy really want to make the car as fun as yup hoping to include last three in this with pole position linked to actual car steering wheel stationary we will try to squeeze it in what are your yes yes yes some of best classic games coming as eggs in release in about 4 thanks ! falcon 9 launches iridium to orbit from air force base will send a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult and most of remaining is we are tiny dust on tiny science oh see expert raise you a üòÄ body shops are ramping up aiming to go from days using external body repair shops to same day body repair with parts at service will leave any comment on actions in flint to those in flint can‚Äôt wait to bring to one of my favorite we should be really worried about this no model 3 is designed to fit adults comfortably in both front rear seats at same time we‚Äôre adding a camper soon to so your car can maintain air selective music power devices for hours or more while big batteries rock not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there‚Äôs room for trunks in front plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car hard drive industry is they build million units per year with extreme precision brutal great there‚Äôs a massive amount of on mars adsorbed into soil that‚Äôd be released upon with enough energy via artificial or natural you can almost any rocky yes we tried out a new delivery system using an enclosed trailer straight from factory to owner‚Äôs so super convenient car arrives in pristine condition without wasting plastic wrap was listening to singularity with but posted this instead have wanted to for so but that would be irresponsible all are you will floating if any formula instantiates it‚Äôs probably that think tweet twice 0 nothing is both real imaginary yes the future is accelerating üò± probably ships next summer side but too much load through center core this is thanks machines that go what‚Äôs worth another hope returns to he left due to relentless attacks from who constantly peddle uncertainty doubt about won the is considered by many to be the best car critic in the explains why there are so many cat videos localized field generators thanks for taking a chance on so many years looking forward to using the new iridium yes trƒìnd we‚Äôve gone from deliveries per week in us last year to it‚Äôs like hitting a square we‚Äôre trying to get rid of contracts should just be here you get your if you don‚Äôt like it for any just return it like any other never seen it so high that‚Äôs really thank looks but so many details need to be journey back from becomes extremely difficult as velocity altitude is velocity is only costs that actually apply to beyond will be it would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current wall street congratulations to all teams in the student to make pods that can operate in vacuum is very was great to meet overheat protection is always but you can also tap your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while model x 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked makes me very sad but also the fault is mine by far he‚Äôs a good guy always look on the bright side of life it is much better sorry ü§ó i love that scene i made that up they did not have phones during the french they used don‚Äôt make me bite my thumb at you for sure is calling wants its method of execution what museum do you plan to great underground power lines would clear up the be safer to have better save lives of many no kidding that will probably be its first use phew we had a drain block 3 months ago people are working hard to make am honored to work with are you trolling for fun or is it part of a what motivates i do you stand by your guillotine statement or literally or that has always been our goal this chart only shows globally competed commercial not us government refers to their skill at obtaining govt contracts subsidies vastly exceeds dunno where this is coming who knows about the but last week we had over and model 3 net we gave up some grip width in exchange for would recommend stickier tires wider on rear for best you might get sec mph or better with optimized rims someone has really thought about i wish his actions against me do not justify my actions against and for that i apologize to and to the companies i represent as the fault is mine and mine as this article my words were spoken in anger after said several untruths suggested i engage in a sexual act with the which had been built as an act of kindness according to specifications from the dive team good point i have never donated to a about of what i donated to , which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue reports that i am a top donor to are categorically i am not a top donor to any political thank you for fighting climate this affects every living creature on that i do not actually see the checks that policy a nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain i have given vastly more to humanitarian so that they are willing to listen when i call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity thanks to be i am not a am registered independent politically doesn‚Äôt mean moderate about all humanitarian issues are extremely important to me i don‚Äôt understand why they are not important to actually true hold up a mirror see if it fogs honored to work with an amazing group of people at but always happy to talk to an ace who might want to join safe to i in a month or so will check with our but i don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to like it spoiler next thing you‚Äôll tell me is they don‚Äôt like feels like a show tell i wonder what the cat dragged in don‚Äôt be too quick to that could go look closely smell neutral good yes wizard alien but i got feather of tickles wrote in joined fellowship interesting read whether you plan to buy a dual motor performance model 3 or take it for a test drive it‚Äôs like having pure fun jacked straight into your brain whenever you performance version suspension is lower has stronger brakes in upgrade package happy happy to gathering input this will begin taking action next week and let people know how they can help even have the could def make some pretty sweet in arrow form if you have cool you‚Äôre in will let you will call tomorrow they should go where their heart takes but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics engineering with my team after a profoundly interesting discussion of philosophy luck with vice president in excellent meetings with senior leaders in very thoughtful about the would love it‚Äôs been too prob early next year just finished an amazing 3 day visit to the world has never seen human energy vigor at such incredibly impressed with china team potential for the sure üåå üí´ at least it‚Äôs not the they‚Äôre basically next just between i have a teleportation to the it‚Äôs so true the pumps i saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave they stopped shortly after boys were rescued water level rose to roof level all way back to cave that was great sounds good glad to hear engineering team also getting feedback from the dive team on how to improve the design for future it will happen for should drive temp to why fan speed on lots of fake accounts on twitter characterized by high ratio to make it seem like many real people when it wonder now i want donuts üç© yeah good maybe use with work by you‚Äôre right on both most houses in flint have safe but they‚Äôve lost faith in govt test some houses are still will organize a weekend in flint to add filters to those houses with issues hopefully fix perception of those that are actually maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter for reply to my tweet with ppm test results will send someone to install a water creating email but in china so that won‚Äôt be working until please consider this a commitment that i will fund fixing the water in any house in flint that has water contamination above no great move why sir üòä it‚Äôs not just a syndrome good point can‚Äôt wait to try been a little distracted past few months on mostly but back at it and like a highly damped trampoline well it looked smaller on paper catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven so we made the net really big caves are now filled with water difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water little kids can in when but it can be deadly to pro divers when pump generator engineering team deserves some credit for the it sometimes feels like reality is a moral i suppose that is what religion tells wonder what i should do makes a lot of sense this reaction has shaken my opinion of many we were asked to create a backup option worked hard to do checked with dive team many times to confirm it was now it‚Äôs there for anyone who needs it in something‚Äôs messed up if this is not a good i think the person who attacked me on twitter will survive somehow thanks for correcting i meant to say over half a million please contamination levels of any kind when you test the water please results of your water tests when you‚Äôre there next are you planning to test water sources for should be very we‚Äôve already made around model 3 performance cars for test drives in exactly it means i created jobs for people directly through parts suppliers supporting people thus supporting half a million what have you already have the when used by is almost always meant to devalue denigrate the i wasn‚Äôt called that until my companies got to a certain but reality is that i still do the same science engineering as just the scale has good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous particularly if toxic gas or dangerous as patient would remain dry at std air pressure entire it was specifically designed to pass that point based on extensive cave video review discussion with several divers who know engineering is absolutely certain that can do entire journey demonstrate at any the former provincial governor inaccurately as is not the subject matter that would be dick who the dive rescue this is our direct great news that they made it out congratulations to an outstanding rescue just returned from cave is ready if it is made of rocket parts named wild boar after soccer leaving here in case it may be useful in the is so that would be i wonder what it‚Äôs like under all that a second one that is shorter is almost complete those videos are from this according to divers who have made the we also made an exact replica that is so that the entire path can be tested without risk of simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage but we‚Äôve not done anything useful it is all other according to divers who have made the this is capable of maneuvering through all passages tube diameter is arriving in about hopefully if perhaps it will be in a future thanks for letting us use your pool it is an honor to work with them with some this could also work as an escape pod in space i want to know who is running the mad it is both alarming explanatory that you run a psych ward diver weight belts wrapped around only weighs so easy to carry on long dry sections of then add weight belts for wet that sounds music makes things calms the adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio aluminum shell has high thermal so will be close to if ambient is a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of they‚Äôre prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold testing for 3 more hours in then it‚Äôs on a plane to design based on dive team feedback 4 air / oxygen ports front front ports protected by dual seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant proof to cave water i am an engineer tight control code is always c python is done great name story if i am a narcissist might be at least i am a useful one python pretty there is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to turbo c given airport soonest we could‚Äôve departed us was an hour but cave now closed for diver will continue testing in la in case needed later or for somewhere else in will even if not useful perhaps it will be in a future extremely talented dive makes sense given yes yes fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights adjust yes 4 points on front 4 on 2 air tank connections on front 2 on allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak in la working with the team building the kid construction complete in about 8 then hour flight to continue to be amazed by the resilience tenacity of kids diving team in human character at its got more great feedback from primary path is basically a submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of falcon rocket as light enough to be carried by 2 small enough to get through narrow extremely ground winds would high altitude ground it‚Äôs a can‚Äôt be too buoyant some good feedback from cave experts in iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to also building an inflatable tube with less likely to given tricky but great if it good idea prob wise to add an air tank end fwd to take in nose of pod vent valve in set air tank to slow bleed then no need for scuba mouthpiece or training unnecessary less susceptible to panic you‚Äôre happy that‚Äôs what talking about in that tweet ‚Äî pressure pod with other approach is a long inflatable air both worth you can put socks on your feet the same there would be no relative motion between the tube rock it‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak unless there is a very big if oxygen % is suggests that leak holes are not i would def recommend this building pressure pods with coating to slip by rocks rope tow hitch lead pockets for neutral cm testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done do the divers think something like this might interesting thanks inflatable tubes pods being made out of for better abrasion a engineer happens to be in is headed there could one of the divers need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube so long as air pressure in tube higher than water air will blow out water won‚Äôt come in does you know output voltage amperage of those generator 3 what will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick beyond only batteries will will prep in case boring co engineers headed to tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to there are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in looks like bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped would need battery air pumps if depth of is would need bar tube prob need to enter zip up then so long as air feed rate exceeds leak tube remains this is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes needs very little power as the work def of done is pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob to more have a small slit entrance exit in circumferential direction stress of longitudinal walking speed is around but if you‚Äôre in an air time doesn‚Äôt matter if tube diameter was a fast walk of would take or just need to duck for the narrow maybe worth insert a diameter nylon tube shorter set of tubes for most difficult through cave network inflate with air like a bouncy should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof to odd shapes like the a journalist who publicly expresses love for parties in with a prominent of any given company should disclose this when writing i know you believe but it means misled readers in her because that is exactly what she said i didn‚Äôt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don‚Äôt work for they just don‚Äôt like they were sent to me by multiple people on the i don‚Äôt use wrote that lee of was her face with in is this why did publish a love letter puff piece about cuff

all media or even all of . just asked if you inform public about an analyst‚Äôs prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your very simple to be , did you compensate or promise to compensate martin for inside information about did under that provide you with exaggerated negative which you but turned out to be , i just asked a simple please , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings extremely bad prediction are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their no one is in the car or controlling car is driving entirely by sounds very sketchy if , is it possible you‚Äôre serving as an inside trading source for one of biggest an employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him he sent you valuable in is this has published several false articles about including a where she claimed scrapped more batteries than our total production which is physically so of wrote article that misled public about model 3 production followed that up with mean tweet to me on my nice work . why did you mislead the people public about this . is relentlessly negative about they just wrote a bogus article saying s production last week was low by annual prod is set at built cars at our standard split last which is right on happy to support boring co has advanced ground penetrating radar is pretty good at digging don‚Äôt know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too if could fully charged and is beautiful was just there with my kids for a few hours to see the got set had dinner at a love the

pickup i have a few things in but what do you think are but important nuances what would be seriously next is super annoying there are lots of who are actually huge but jump on every social cause but really proud of the fact that # of changes had to make to achieve even knowing about the was don‚Äôt buy our car if that‚Äôs a people should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them then you will really hate that scored four years in a row on equality we must aspire to truth important to read the wash post the to account number does not refer to actual lost it refers to calls not

release so big you can‚Äôt believe it vicious torque factory . good exactly what is my sentient thanks üñ§ at until late is but have to say that crew is pulling off miracles against all infinity the reality game that would be tricky to but maybe was thinking of offering an extended factory tour option where you could help build part of a car understand how they come i know it would have been super fun for me when i was a kid _ it‚Äôs called top secret yes when i was a i built model rockets my own explosives surprised i still have all a lots of built a primitive machine in but not sure what the big deal i like building if that ends up being useful work even we will add a to lower the alert apply light force to the steering alert is being changed to this try saying might work ironic if the bug report about bug reports isn‚Äôt working thanks for the will investigate sure it‚Äôs actually pretty fun building electric product is useful to other people good for i think that‚Äôs

thanks for coming by our car factory with . team was super fired up to see congrats on your that was over years thanks for believing in there is but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop from reaching its with the worst 1 in will have that‚Äôs still it‚Äôs kinda there in us with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn‚Äôt change even if you get a productivity should be because honey is a vegetable considerably less so than our competitors consumption tax is way higher estate tax better than gains probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not exactly he‚Äôs forcing function for any share monopolist to improve is weak a national govt is that by one may find lowish correlation for but that does not mean low great a little on the that‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating for is vastly better than any govt at allocating consumption vs capital allocation extremely biggest missing piece in public understanding of what tax rate of seems about below is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is outsourced above too

am one of the top donors to i couldn‚Äôt even keep the us in the but if there is some way for me to help these kids i will do so i think so i hope the kids are shelter you‚Äôre probably maybe after drama calms at the factory a pretty good workout just walking it‚Äôs they look beautiful will maybe do a media tour next team deserves this was it‚Äôs actually way better than the factory more comfortable a great view of the not sure we actually need a this tent is pretty line is in place at spooling up they super kicked ass they also poured the concrete built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in and it‚Äôs way better than the other line that cost hundreds of no needed another general assembly line to reach model 3 a new building was so we built a giant tent in 2 team love them so much you‚Äôre bad fiction writer we are which is extremely pro people can form a union tomorrow nothing could do to stop can‚Äôt even get enough to request a cause they have nothing to your union

so keeps trashing me via glad you teach that and critical thinking how not to be are foundational for all kids to i think we pretty much great i think essential incl health should be taken care of by other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people the view held by most of they started it attacked me personally search and very long reading great just means you earned more money than you spent certainly does spark this is a good thing extremely it has taken years we‚Äôre almost every other us car company besides ford has gone they don‚Äôt seem to think much

think all companies are bad and all unions that‚Äôs a very bigoted well said then you‚Äôll be fine our is actually shorter simpler than clearly doesn‚Äôt and wall street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at storm clouds are so they‚Äôre getting then look a little read the whole more the only prevents disclosure of proprietary or material information how big is your short just union are handed out all the time in the i know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda hand them to this one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and i endorse freedom to form a union as well as freedom not to do so if they feel is a good has major conflicts of interest failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in can only hire of so must

dual motor performance coming off the line you‚Äôre a docile puppet of the be honest about what you yes sigh by the i am actually a just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to

a government school for anyone which we were lake show heading back into the so that‚Äôs enough for don‚Äôt take my tweet too for one it‚Äôs called a no my father has no only reason he even has a house is because my brother i bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to that obviously there is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption wealth as labor by latter anyone in govt whose budget exceeds is a government is the largest socialism vs capitalism is not even the right what really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people‚Äôs universal income will be necessary over time if takes over most human jobs was a he even wrote a book about a socialist those who proclaim themselves are usually have no sense of humor attended an expensive fate loves what is

a sponge have heard universally great things about your of but it‚Äôs the kind of hustle that you like even with full people can read the internet anyone who wants a refund will get i predict basically the fun value is amazing we‚Äôre never going to make them trade is just that roadster becomes a 2 instead of a in place of the kid which is prob wise for many reasons total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs but power output is the composite pressure vessel is most advanced ever it‚Äôs what is qualifying for crewed extremely robust ‚Äî literally not recommended for urban environments yes the actual amount of time i spend on twitter is my tweets are literally what thinking at the not carefully crafted corporate which is really just banal it is amazingly hard to find a simple a complicated one is relatively love this simpler the add an r for roadster this is crux of can‚Äôt make system too annoying or people won‚Äôt use negatively affecting but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue a lot of people whose judgment i respect have suggested sounds like a good will do so after model 3 production reaches not tempting fate too much with that it was meant as a but is about the right actual will do pure wish orbital rockets could be so but there‚Äôs no escaping newton‚Äôs third is already developing high efficiency capture with to form liquid critical for propellant production at mars base you have my next gen roadster will be absolutely out of this for those who love to there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a rocket the air exiting the would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air which is most of the intent of new roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by no thus transferring the effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure that issue is better in latest autopilot software rolling out now fully fixed in august update as part of our version to autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on with we will begin to enable full this is why not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while i was in newsrooms all round the world say that if i only knew how newsrooms really then know everything‚Äôs fine no need for a media credibility rating system like ü§î also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional city papers online

created internet startup w bro bro loved may he we don‚Äôt think our product will be the cause of any but the boring company is donating using the you plus an electric pump to replenish air in when car power draw drops below max pack power makes but we are going to go a lot years when my company got i had to decide between buying a house in alto or a car ever was no i bought a small condo that was much cheaper than the new roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every option package for new roadster will include small rocket arranged seamlessly around these rocket engines dramatically improve top braking maybe they will even allow a to fly terms conditions for please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things for simple concise we drew upon wisdom in great book eggs

to ensure super fast excellent outcome talked with looks like we can do the aluminum model 3 pedal covers different from turning on production for model 3 performance should be on renewable energy solar with some by next of solar already actually closer to but with larger inner diameter and we‚Äôre definitely going to have a pod bay door override lesson will also have augmented mode that will massively enhance human driving like a flying metal but in car form running track in bf spaceship will look something like this no plans for aluminum adds too much production model 3 will def have which will get way more advanced for s x w autopilot all model 3 working on improving no way 6 is enough for i come 7 is oh that‚Äôs overkill tip of the day coming soon we are ramping production as fast as wait should be closer to 6 months not 2 congratulations . good move by . please use twitter essence of a good editor we are extending the net area by a factor of 4 am def not under any

mason jars with a handle or wine stem cause me to lose faith in humanity the future i was an alien they don‚Äôt even realize all they know is that some pr agency is pushing a story that will get that

from the solar energy is more than most people per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar no more need to import fossil fuels for which is a strategic but don‚Äôt cars have been tested for

love their and the views are yes there are no at least you have so many great pics p first and then production costs are always high when line first gets so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative as production efficiency we can make lower cost versions not lose i really want to make this a dream that prob be a nightmare in cup holder that auto adjusted for

suggesting public i was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their this is way worse than i the arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same

on something needs to be done to reward high quality some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the odd turns out is actually owned by for some didn‚Äôt bother to correct me for some didn‚Äôt bother to correct me tried to buy but said turns out they already use definitely did been through many press cycles know full well same person praising me today will trash me journos hound me constantly for but i do almost none these twitter as it allows me to bypass journo just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest yet believe that same public is too stupid immoral to assess their it‚Äôs amazing that you don‚Äôt understand how insufferably hypocritical that the facility is open plan we‚Äôre not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo i know journalists too well they are some of the worst best human beings ever you‚Äôre the no applies to everything therefore means definitely indicates because has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world products that haven‚Äôt been unveiled you don‚Äôt have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product you‚Äôre don‚Äôt remember but disclosing classified us missile technology to hostile nations would violate law land you in i didn‚Äôt review but my team obviously nobody cared about what your article done have a confirmed real name identity section an unconfirmed identity latter with that excludes probable be careful what you wish for the is vote is despite hundreds of articles attacking this very my point exactly you have in your that is synonymous with is great come on you can do get more people to vote for you are literally the the point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the they don‚Äôt realize how little credibility they actually have with the why are certain journalists so concerned about the public rating their all they do all day is rate ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have i did to any who asked that was obvious from a mile i tried to use their product it didn‚Äôt not exactly a genius move by but they were brave enough to say maybe after you get your model we can talk about what you like what needs to be improved but consider it we could unveil model y anytime from late this year to mid next so march is about i just made that because the ides of march sounded good gasoline or what car do you march the media hi open to right cranking super hard at the so it depends on how things are going next maybe the media credibility rating site should be called i do actually own but for the moment i just have it automatically forward to definitely there no good car i mean what the heck are these üöó üöô and this is the best one üöò yo that‚Äôs the basic idea for some this is the best felt in a hope you‚Äôre feeling good too i just tried to but you don‚Äôt accept when you you just tweeted about so you do thank i thought it was so obvious does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other i think you do great work if you‚Äôre in media don‚Äôt want to write an article telling your readers to vote against it ü§ó never stopped a union vote nor removed a abandoned this arrived gave people back their they haven‚Äôt forgotten betrayed that‚Äôs why can‚Äôt even get people to attend a free let alone enough for a of course it is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than millions more auto but somehow get less we are not but we‚Äôre doing our best to make clean energy real be a good they‚Äôre just some rich kids in who took their political science prof too seriously will do create a media credibility rating site also flags propaganda that‚Äôs why editors are included too we the media is reporting someone else saying that it is even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility the editors publications it is how they define enough of the public does care about the i have faith in the maybe some good people from those who would join not only needs to be but seek unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army exactly going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article track the credibility score over time of each editor thinking of calling it an exception that proves the rule this is how many characters do you problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks earn advertising dollars or get tricky as doesn‚Äôt but fossil fuel companies car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest the media has earned this but maybe there is a oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above try being truthful the public will believe you thought you‚Äôd say anytime anyone criticizes the the media shrieks just like why do you think he got elected in the first because no ones believes you any you lost your credibility a long time the hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the but publish only enough to sugarcoat the is why the public no longer respects them this will sound super but genesis oblivion i am not cool the one about to come out called so heavy i fell through the earth was sad to see g getting tons of undeserved flak because of so glad there‚Äôs some good too her music is not super fun right now üòî busted üëª none of those criteria are certain by but when taken together messages have an it almost always indicates use of a network of troll accounts troll dead not using real fake pics low account recently repeating same etc great will do it later this too much on plate right will be available as an upgrade from love original that would be interesting he stops at that‚Äôs when you drove gm into bankruptcy lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on just order your car with the bond option it‚Äôs an item for those in the know üòâ but ya know let‚Äôs test that maybe we do want even tho betrayed us 8 years ago left us here to maybe we want back even tho injury rate today is what it was with them wages were let‚Äôs hold a vote find in theory but not how they drove gm to bankruptcy lost jobs for people they were supposed to incl abandoning plant took over now it has destroyed once great us auto industry everyone knows we‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden eggs in x what do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch good point does they want divisiveness enforcement of 2 class that us fought war of independence to get of a 2 class managers workers be equal w easy movement either managing sucks hate doing it so more is overseen by most stringent labor safety org in they‚Äôve never found us to on other gm have repeatedly been found to fake safety that info is missing from reveal article no problem they are we never nor have we ever been scheduled to thanks have conveyed your words to the who have been working crazy really i didn‚Äôt meet with him i definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute need to have long uninterrupted times to can‚Äôt be creative just wanted to say thanks to all i damn well love have been meaning to get around to talking to some of his criticisms are on the higher weight he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other thanks critical feedback after you get the car would be much no matter how to be all model 3 incl early production will have same great braking nature of any is that if you care about you make constant small today‚Äôs model s is far more refined than initial abs calibration algorithm consumer reports has an early production model 3 now has improved ride lower wind noise many other small will request that they test current looks like this can be fixed with a firmware will be rolling that out in a few with further we can improve braking distance beyond initial won‚Äôt stop until model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable you‚Äôre making me blush not promising but we be able to increase model 3 performance power output a little complexity is the words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the model 3 production ramp trying to get to but we‚Äôll good we will do that for the bigger the braking result is inconsistent with other but might indicate that some model have longer braking distances than if we will address this at our first time we‚Äôve seen anything like even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing we will make sure all model having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers very model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance others reviewers have confirmed if there is vehicle we will figure it out may just be a question of firmware in which case can be solved by an software we can do the interview at in front of the yellow barriers beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt please send your meeting request to been for super love working with did for job security in last dropped like a hot potato to protect their core base in to exit this plant before even we had nothing to do with but everything to do with why people here have nothing stopping team at our car plant from voting could do so if they but why pay union dues give up stock options for our safety record is better than when plant was everybody already gets factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines report about forklifts not beeping is also these are both demonstrably but were reported as by we‚Äôre working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a pinpoint origin by acoustic signature

after to ship that means literally your mom could file for exactly that will be really fun shed light on what‚Äôs hoping to start that later this year after we become difficult to justify before was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that make workplace injury rate of our factory when it was w was twice as high as today‚Äôs about of incl salaried union were let go in annual only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened supporters verbally on social media lied about yes exactly they can form a union whenever they want there‚Äôs nothing i can do to stop is a very

car in the world apart from model traction control precision is super it does so but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell depends on when you placed your initial we start delivering the dual motor model 3 in three or four depending on demand we have enough for about right good idea that is electric motors are far more reliable than combustion you need an electric motor just to start a gas dual motor means there is a motor in front a motor in one is optimized for power one for car drives fine even if a motor breaks helps ensure you make it to your destination don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe cost of normal dual motor option is range is also takes to sec top speed to black white interior available only for model 3 performance initially due to limited parts will broaden over is dual so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks cost of all etc is included from cost is about same as but quicker with better will beat anything in its class on the dual drive performance model sec mph top speed mile range it‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to price to car but owner happiness is way so worth doing exactly will soon enable owners to request service from

coming but the boring company is right behind you at your speed soon will be start sweating he taunts us with his speed just an ordinary snail his name is he‚Äôs a snail üêå skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever excited for partnership with la metro listening to there are thousands of supercharger locations going through including that will publish an updated map in the next few yes will be presenting taking questions about the boring company plans for at on boring company will take you from city center under ground ocean to spaceport in to time will but so far it appears so it certainly needs to be better we work to improve it every but perfect is enemy of a system on saves lives reduces injuries should be what‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a model s hit a fire truck at and the driver only broke an an impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or it‚Äôs super messed up that a crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the people who died in us auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage yes according to there was an automotive fatality every miles in was every it‚Äôs not possible to be but probability of fatality is much lower in a we will be reporting updated safety numbers after each this is rejected for being not for fails to mention that is safest car on which would make article approx better than happy mother‚Äôs day love you so fair but we‚Äôre fixing it going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production looks lovely story if someone is trying to control us through complicated sky they must really i would gladly obey their but i can‚Äôt figure them will prob build to rocket cores for missions over 5 then takes over falcon goal of is to enable anyone to move to mars eventually outer good piece by rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get i like steam engines trains in i heard this so many in the it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing yo will make that a setting fossil fuels subsidized at million a hours a 7 days a week no use arguing with you‚Äôre that article was pushed as propaganda to counter study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be even if was combined market cap of is where did the other come ass üé© i have publicly asked people not to go fund ford or whatever launching in white interior in air suspension prob that‚Äôs when we making can‚Äôt instantly fill all will take months to do our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than which means has prospered in spite of govt not because of cap has over time as incentives how strange i love it but trying to keep simple so as not to blow up the production ramp will enable orders end of next week for dual motor starting production of those in air suspension prob next a cool thing about the design is that‚Äôs easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all already started dc to hopefully start la to sf next that will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels faster than first boring company tunnel under la almost pending towards end of next planning to launch in turkey later this love your country will be there in person for the this will work on entire s x even first production cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought all x s will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w signal strength is high you enable feature we will add that as a feature unnecessary will i wrote that masterpiece myself in thanks for the i will match the donation from my my a cover of paradise is

to me that the plot of willy is really messed up i am super super serious starting a candy company it‚Äôs going to be amazing this will be bigger i try so hard to help them thanks for letting me will sorry for the looks like sooner than the sheer magnitude of short carnage will be if you‚Äôre i suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit new roadster will have that definitely not it will be next these are really big oh and uh short burn of the century flamethrowers should arrive just in yup and once they were on the i should have answered their questions it was foolish of me to ignore we went through the same drama on s x and almost all confirmed in the will likely be even better for model as customer satisfaction score post delivery is i worry zero about just spent all night in the not the reason question about model 3 demand is absurd is that has roughly half a million despite no advertising no cars in even after reaching it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to the reason the question about was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the newsletter he received along with details in the body of the letter the 2 questioners i ignored on the call are analysts who represent a short seller not investors exactly it‚Äôs important to know that is the most shorted most bet stock on the market has been for a while please ignore this thread unless you‚Äôre interested in a tedious discussion about stock they were neither valid nor i will explain why on a primary twitter news is actually super model s x are producing major positive cash flow model 3 is about to do to be a big fan of but this is an important clarification the questions were not asked by but rather by two analysts who were trying to justify their short they are actually on the side of represented actual so i switched to you‚Äôre most welcome your numbers are is in world after a place will be largest when woke la la la crew dragon ships to the cape in about 3 months üñ§ üñ§ falcon 9 fairing opens its after reentering the atmosphere that‚Äôs how i use my eyebrows too i have prehensile eyebrows üòâ most people don‚Äôt know but comets r mostly made of cocaine almost ready to test the new boring company / exciting video don‚Äôt make me use my space lasers i know such an market oh building a cyborg dragon sounds great riding my cyborg üêâ likewise was just listening to go flex psycho on playlist mostly not batteries are currently live delivering power at locations in team is working to activate several hundred has great rocket technology much would encourage focus on rockets cannot be competitive any more than doing our best now driving a model 3 and playing would be great to hear your we‚Äôre going to try a few can def be just about minimizing we already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in pacific w no islands or so upper stage doesn‚Äôt become a dead need to closer to shore position catcher ship like and then land on a bouncy house but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all mach regimes drops ballistic coefficient by 2 orders of magnitude will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon this is gonna sound but interview and factory tour with king too wasted to remember don‚Äôt want to brag or but that happens to me sometimes excessive automation at was a to be my humans are the economist used to be but smart with a wicked dry now it‚Äôs just boring will be profitable cash in so no need to raise demand has been higher than making them as fast as but is 3 to 6 looking into this is maybe a little üòâ got it she‚Äôs i love trolls has some really cool tunnels and bridges should be fully fixed within the next few days place your bets this is a very important action by avoiding a trade war will benefit all how many main body tool for the interplanetary spaceship free viewing ends in about 5 hours will take corrective action sorry about looking into it now should just be due to your not avail if not similar timing so probably we need to achieve with model 3 before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp this is kinda nutty for such a short so could easily end up being shredded but exciting either way upgraded pod speed test will try to reach half speed of sound within model 3 is the whole we only made the more expensive cars in order to make the we lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until the cat videos are awesome üê± at views after congrats to exactly are my but i am your ‚Äî in memory of hawking nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital watch new movie for free until night at movie premiering tonight we will add a feature to allow request of latest software version this is false it‚Äôs on most people don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs a whole box of eggs with every just tap logo on center screen easy access to most of discovered more coming i need to build cars about a year i asked to manage both engineering he agreed that needed prod better so we don‚Äôt design cars that are crazy hard to right better to divide so back to sleeping at car biz is hell can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre even writing about my job as is to focus on what‚Äôs most which is currently model 3 who i regard as one of the world‚Äôs most talented engineering is focused on vehicle we release as soon as we have the good bad doesn‚Äôt not just as asking sure there‚Äôs a really great answer policy is to issue a recall there are this is absolutely the right thing to yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last incl w injuries but you only wrote an article about why not going to do an fool‚Äôs joke about going if i thought there was any chance it would actually happen lot of respect for but regulates not which is an advisory releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately always to do otherwise would be oh forgot to mention it actually landed just not on what about university is a real place coming soon to free shots in stores every as you wish it‚Äôs the best was found passed out against a model surrounded by the tracks of dried tears still visible on his this is not a what's the happy new there are many chapters of bankruptcy as critics so rightly pointed has them including chapter and a half worst goes bankrupt despite intense efforts to raise including a mass sale of we are sad to report that has gone completely and totally so you can't believe important news in a few hours love seeing the scars of the rocket actual video coming aiming to improve the link quality so it can be everything‚Äôs better with fire best music video art seen in a while drat guided so fairing impacted water at high air wake from fairing messing w doing drop tests in next few weeks to is 5 away from being under the falling fairing have live attempting recovery of fairing falling down from space with our it‚Äôs a giant steel webbing catcher‚Äôs mitt superstructure on a ocean s house party for the autonomous peasant how'd i forgot my dueling dwarf while dressed as a knight and using a parasol for a sword turns out joking about being a star because of digging tunnels rock ‚Äî is deeply underappreciated you can upgrade although we also wrote software to accelerate rendering on old coming out soon makes a big from my every time i use i lose a friend and they said never be a rock star yes it‚Äôs literally made of rock the boring bricks are interlocking with a precise surface so two people could build the outer walls of a small house in a day or so prob may guaranteed to be first kit set will be ancient ‚Äî temple of etc new boring company coming interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures rated for seismic so super but bored in the like an aircraft wing so not new starts rolling out this should be considered a mature beta at so won‚Äôt be but will improve with the old we were stuck with legacy party black box code and stale no way to shocker it‚Äôs not a political statement and i didn‚Äôt do this because someone dared me to do just don‚Äôt like gives me the i have just asked our team to slow down it is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and customer happiness safety matter more than a few extra cars this you‚Äôll live we‚Äôve never advertised with none of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake product lives or dies on its own probably so long as it stays fairly i don‚Äôt use never so don‚Äôt think some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge we don‚Äôt advertise or pay for so don‚Äôt a how dare my fault for being an we did give them a free launch to make up for it and i think they had some looks lame first time seen one on the left looks will be gone maybe that word doesn‚Äôt mean what i think it does literally never seen it even once it‚Äôs influence is slowly creeping i didn‚Äôt realize there was will who‚Äôd say a thing like what‚Äôs a whole risky yes i them to come bring it no technology is too advanced for the boring that deserves a lot of credit for supporting commercial space launch while under massive assault from monopolists no real surface is but it did pull about lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel probably mid next year before we are able to make wish it could be maybe try a model used or new in the used s is better than a new 3 unless you want a smaller sorry ü§ó model x pulls a lb above us road legal semi truck on a pure snow surface sounds like this canton has you‚Äôre sorry for the only just got back from will be at our factory in the team is going all better to be in the model x the police are electricity vs diesel maintenance more than make up for purchase price the bad guys will def not that‚Äôs worth a lot maybe there should be 2 providers for advanced monopolies are so boring and mars this is creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to if it was about just do another internet this is completely never even heard of just taking my kids on a spring break trip to see ancient historical sites in paid respects to earlier live free or learning how to pour flaming absinthe over a tower of glasses in a thanks for your support over all those your cruel taunts cut me i love you oh you guys i find it yes good point that‚Äôs the name of my new intergalactic media exclamation point optional resist great my and i are going to do a cover of my little buttercup from the three it will be there will also be a plethora of q and sometimes even on the set with my bro why falcon heavy life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after there need to be things that inspire that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of that is why we did we did for doesn‚Äôt make any you can‚Äôt things that make them work without creativity it‚Äôs not none of the above tunnels because blue i guess you could say it‚Äôs a electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and a better video coming but it would look a bit like boring co urban loop system would have of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination blend seamlessly into the fabric of a rather than a small number of big stations like a subway definitely will still transport but only after all personalized mass transit needs are it‚Äôs a matter of courtesy if someone can‚Äôt afford a they should go adjusting the boring company all tunnels will prioritize pedestrians cyclists over cars heavy sigh is in finishing her second it‚Äôs about a future matriarchal with a will be at with who created made an incredible short reel of falcon heavy releases to be i think a fair outcome for all is quite china has already shown a willingness to open their markets and i believe they will do the right we raised this with the prior administration and nothing just want a fair ideally where are equally nothing hope this does not seem i am against import duties in but the current rules make things very it‚Äôs like competing in an race wearing lead no us auto company is allowed to own even of their own factory in but there are five auto companies in the us for an car going to china pays import but a car coming to the us only pays a tenfold difference do you think the us china should have equal fair rules for same import ownership constraints other every time an angel so thank goodness depends on what you mean by first production cargo trip of the semi heavy duty carrying battery packs from will have model x do a cover of happy birthday by if you type shows this emoji ü§ó i just realized there is a jazz hands emoji ü§ó if there is anyone in the third turn off air third row cooling happens by air entering from the front and exiting through the vents in the rear very proud of the can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been fifty falcon 9 launches just ten years we couldn‚Äôt even reach orbit with little falcon falcon 9 flight launches carrying for at 6 metric tons and almost the size of a city it will be the largest geostationary satellite we‚Äôve ever very sensible summary of supersonic obvious answer is to fly which gives low drag low boom amplitude at if boom too design probably wrong good will add to feature that should improve software team has been buried in model 3 and tricky bug but that‚Äôs mostly done almost done deep in the hole with my boring sometimes when we the honesty‚Äôs too much probably about a tenth of the cost and a fifth of the time want to clarify that as the people responsible for the high costs long timelines are almost all but the system of incentives is messed up higher safety environmental requirements labor costs explain only a small part of the true root cause is an exponential growth in bureaucracy a private sector consultant industry earning a % on project them to maximize and new and we are even worse than that in china‚Äôs progress in advanced infrastructure is more than times faster than the us if even pinker doesn‚Äôt understand the difference between and general when the latter has a million times more compute power and an utility humanity is in deep trouble encryption encoded at firmware unlikely to be hacked w current computing if it is we learn about a fix will go out immediately via firmware will be simpler than and have tiny packet definitely am feeling optimistic about beating the semi specs announced at the unveiling for the same the semi will be something really can someone please do i would def that was a don‚Äôt tell but the password is a b will attempt to beam in about hours when they pass near la first two demo called a deployed and communicating to earth stations falcon fairing half as seen from our catcher‚Äôs mitt in boat no apparent about a month this was an older version so no recovery attempted missed by a few hundred but fairing landed intact in should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down made it back from space and fairing just now trying to catch it going to try to catch the giant fairing of falcon 9 as it falls back from space if you love drones above your you‚Äôll really love vast numbers of flying over your head that are times bigger and noisier and blow away anything that isn‚Äôt nailed down when they land not i let but it‚Äôs still i literally own zero apart from that a friend sent me many years that‚Äôs just random if anyone is the name was inspired by the fault in our stars high altitude wind shear data shows a probable load but better to be postponing launch to assuming winds are better today‚Äôs falcon launch carries 2 test satellites for global if constellation will serve least strange delta iv heavy has half the payload of falcon heavy and the rocket doesn‚Äôt exist i don‚Äôt get the little ship you can‚Äôt show up at mars in something the

production and set to fly in a few months is block team is submitting updated not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine fix is pretty to support high flight rates for and dual ocean landings for side boosters no a shortfall of gravitas a third is under construction under we‚Äôve already stretched the upper stage easiest part of the rocket to fairing flying also has a slightly larger could make fairing much longer if need be will if takes longer than _ side boosters landing on center expended is only performance penalty vs fully cost is only slightly higher than an expended so around _ of course maybe that plan works but i will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before that was three years before all medium versions of delta future missions have all delta fixed costs piled so their cost is now for missions contracted for launch after nutty both exhaust velocity and mass ratio drive the rocket also matters a lot for delta upper stage is but mass ratio and thrust are the performance numbers in this database are not in process of being even if they a fully expendable falcon which far exceeds the performance of a delta iv is compared to over for delta iv love and rockets if i can just figure out how to attach those to a really big shark falcon heavy engine plumes

will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher flamethrowers sold out of course yes this rocket was meant to test very high landing in water so it didn‚Äôt hurt the but amazingly it has we

at cape easy viewing from the public falcon heavy firing this morning was generated quite a thunderhead of launching in a week or check for updates done you will be able to do pretty much anything via voice software team is focused on core model 3 functionality right but that will be done then we will add a lot more there aren‚Äôt even good normal parties in silicon you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in there are other items you can upgrade too but i recommend keeping those parts that sounds will fixed in next release long exposure of rocket reentry from space and landing ) good we can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into of and an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie near gonna put an old school roller skates rock restaurant at one of the new supercharger locations in la falcon heavy goes vertical using a neural net to detect rain using cameras dedicated rain or sun computers

other star systems with known for a laser sail is good but it‚Äôs too secret hopefully fully operational in boring co is completing its first commercial tunnel in going from convention center to then will work on other projects he‚Äôs still much faster üêå these would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only ‚Äî no toxic fumes is the just an underground but limited to all auto this is not in place of other light but supplemental to done by dawn that would be a fringe benefit build super tunnels under cities to solve traffic flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away we‚Äôre now building flight design of but each will have at least minor at least through or so of was up all night with team working on tank dome production difficult part of primary dawn arrives please stop spamming bleak links into a paywall activating engine two it is an honor a privilege to work with so many great engineers the overarching goal of engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve it‚Äôs not that these things can‚Äôt be they just absorb a lot of software engineering which has great opportunity there are very few excellent software engineers merely increasing team size results in awful future feature turn on auto navigate feature car will activate navigation to home or depending on as soon as you sit no input required at but one step at a anything we release to the fleet has big

accurate good point don‚Äôt wanna brag but was me also fake rapper write games yes regarding to 3 hardware that should happen in earnest in software feature delta was zero until so not much point in doing it before pretty although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems love the real constraint is finding great software sure sorry for the delay on we just couldn‚Äôt get it all done in this has been necessary for many but hopefully not forever it‚Äôs been a bit of a software team has been working all weekend to resolve last minute hopefully starts rolling out my wiki is a war zone with a zillion at least it‚Äôs obviously not some i should probably write what fictionalized version of reality is yes started with of student rolled proceeds into rolled proceeds again into but these are all companies where i played fundamental founding not right to ask others to put in money if i don‚Äôt put in if go so will as it should just looked at my wiki for time in it‚Äôs can someone please delete i do basically zero cut would be another milestone sending you healing vibes that‚Äôs certainly our but it‚Äôs an old version of so effect is limited the real reason for was to travel back in time stop a terrible calamity ‚Äî the premiere of for sure great show üêº holiday gift ideas we‚Äôre working on moving more cars to end of year delivery is very proud of team for all their hard yes it‚Äôs been years i try so hard with these begins for orbit is best wishes for landing swift recovery to next does it like the needs a few more days of then early then wide release holiday software update has sneak lost backgammon a few other things you don‚Äôt hear much about element as that‚Äôs hardware cinnamon toast crunch this is quite a thorny hardware as there are many diff versions of autopilot computer supporting cars last so much longer than hopefully able to upgrade in a few this mode will show pic of moth play the smiths moth mode late than just costs a few thousand dollars is more complex than a board bunch of connectors antennas need to we can improve the speed a little with software which might be i think we can improve that with a little software optimization _ this is a great meme upgrade not recommended isn‚Äôt needed for full cost is for limited entertainment never trust as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it probably partially some good ideas telemetry indicates soft touchdown on the so fairing might still be reusable sigh possibly but recommend reading player of games surface detail they‚Äôre all yes raptor is making great just finished an engineering review with engine is about to ship to with some holiday style age of napoleon is excellent this is how we will view fossil fuel cars crossing

audience kids these days have no that‚Äôs the it really does they smashed the window to steal the which was worth maybe got a replacement from great deals available from it‚Äôs pretty fun that i bought in for i it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model i found in a junkyard when the 4 speed transmission couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for so i fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the that‚Äôs me replacing broken side window the circle is complete maybe on it‚Äôs def got the payload capacity just wish would improve the of his is this too much to it‚Äôs one of my favorite we‚Äôll aim to have it come out same time as two electric designed to work with will be electric dirt bikes would be cool we won‚Äôt do road as too i was hit by a truck almost died on one when i was your twitter comments are great huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to it‚Äôs better because of this may sound but asking real people what they‚Äôd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs there will be no loss of either that will require a full but probably inches or cm width more for parking at really needs to fit in same external envelope as a but with better height control with air so it can fit in low clearance parking we can prob reduce width by an inch maybe reduce length by inches without losing on utility or min height is below inches when air suspension set to will post exact number speed solves everything he‚Äôs def solar power is a gigawatt per square all you need is a by mile patch in a deserted corner of or to more than power the entire this analysis goes through super strong roof that generates clean looks great costs less than a normal roof plus solar huge admiration respect for the china their talent drive is for sure if we create a city on travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive launching third flight of this dragon spacecraft to tomorrow yes after a hydrogen became sentient right thing to short selling should be people often think they‚Äôre breathing but are actually breathing nitrogen with a side serving of oxygen in argon sauce spiced up with a dash of neon krypton hydrogen is a odorless given enough turns into people who will make this statement still can‚Äôt believe how hard it was to get we sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us then he said yes was almost called as original holder of motors trademark refused to sell it to it‚Äôs artificial do you like our overall shape is good for low drag matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges guide air around like an invisible laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated that‚Äôs why has active suspension height damping control safety work is done by with passive safety by active by design in automotive refers to look they are dead to me it‚Äôs a generational thing with extreme might hit a drag which would be insane for a requires tweaking many small just because he has a flamethrower and i have a flamethrower doesn‚Äôt mean um fine hank this one is happy the finest in apocalypse protection flamethrower def not dainty will have steel balls we‚Äôd be happy to help will aim to do this next week this will be exciting to electric motors also have insane if we load both trucks to the electric still physics is the everything else is a bring it on is inspired by games like warthog sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of which is why steel ball didn‚Äôt bounce should have done steel ball on sledgehammer the next time pulls uphill higher higher strength doesn‚Äôt cost crazy money for skins in this is something should do we should def make it good to hang out there is our last product unveil for a but there will be some unexpected technology announcements next year good it‚Äôs a new variant of series stainless but it also gets many depending on of can be wrapped in any the body panels will actually be laser long it probably makes sense to build a smaller too interesting idea true hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level new manufacturing methods are certainly but then confident it will actually cost because of its simplicity lower part study the we‚Äôre creating this alloy at not a problem to create a lot of but we‚Äôll need to come up with new body manufacturing as it can‚Äôt be made using standard steel decision came we were going to use titanium skins for but stainless is much even bending it requires a deep score on inside of which is how the prototype was made reason is so planar is that you can‚Äôt stamp because it breaks the stamping press excellent review by yes v true with no advertising no paid endorsement orders so with choosing single motor great analysis that would be cool gonna have some sick attachments armored personnel carrier riding in the sure throws steel ball at window right before guess we have some improvements to make before production mead we threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event didn‚Äôt even scratch the better truck than an faster than a order online at yes will be an option to add solar power that generates miles per possibly would love this to be adding fold out solar wings would generate to miles per avg miles per day in us is 2 person electric will come at first as an option for see ya in üòâ nobody the yup high time we had a design influenced partly by the spy who loved me coming we‚Äôre working to complete the full supercharger route from to will be official truck of mars of course fun party long journey tonight but to move to this had some value as a manufacturing but flight design is quite maybe won‚Äôt need a key at all so many reporters gave airtime when he called a worthless now that he has been proven silence gravitas is overrated that would be cool national science u should add a w to would get way more of people want to gentrify the china space industry is very impressive have a strange intelligence it certainly does true not maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental even who made the that is guess i was obsessed with space from an early fair be way too embarrassed to put that on a it‚Äôs like a kid‚Äôs congratulations on the mach cars are the excited to see this announcement from as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric well surprisingly common unveil night innovation comes in many ways meaning not fair that gets so much more for the same thing this doesn‚Äôt seem right true seems = right trajectory of symbiosis doesn‚Äôt appear to intersect trajectory of goal of is to raise this probability above we fought the last year gentrify it was memes are modern art üñ§ irony there will be many opportunities for both new experienced 4 makes sense congrats to team on model 3 winning best midsize car in will build starting with model y vertical on the pad yes exactly without a fully rapidly reusable orbital humanity will never be a species bad logic is always ugly same goes for digital super intelligence denial üòò yes deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust other variants will have engine production is gearing up to build about a raptor a day by next so up to engines per most will be the high ton thrust no throttle no variant for super cumulative could thus be as high as raptor is evolving probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even until roughly engine although probably engines can be retrofitted for orbital especially on super which is less sensitive to engine it just needs crazy up pretty much it‚Äôs also a far more exciting inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the than forever confined to earth until some eventual extinction however far in the future that may be very in the assuming you even make it there mars will be far more dangerous difficult than earth take decades of hard labor to make that‚Äôs the sales want to so it will take about years to transfer a million tons to mars base which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable as the planets align only once every two years a thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable mars city no we could program to perform swan lake in the minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs current global payload to orbit capacity is about tons per of which falcon is about half if we build as many as so vehicles each does tons to that‚Äôs a capacity of million tons of payload to orbit per year payload to orbit per year of fleet is most as it‚Äôs designed to fly per which is per year the economics have to be something like that to build a city on mars cars too true extremism is so of yes the date is strangely familiar unveil on in la near rocket factory looking into it yes the audience of entrepreneurs should try not the naturally this is based on an incorrect the air force asked me to speak at a startup conference called i happened to mention they don‚Äôt buy it‚Äôs the air fair coming we‚Äôre making foundational upgrades to the core corporate right after autonomous cars require great advanced factories also require great the car industry is not very good at more to come yes would be odd to expect anything else that most spaceports will probably need to be miles / offshore for acceptable noise especially for frequent daily as would occur for point to point flights on earth seems like eons with fairing falcon is but takes several days requires will be fully reusable with booster possible every few hours ship every 8 no boats great poem great work by dragon team to be we‚Äôve only done 1 test of so 9 more left to reach successful tests in a putting model s in range mode is the opposite of launch as it minimizes performance in favor of show should be called vs üéÉ happy drag times is top gear is wrong drag race times analysis is there‚Äôs a software upgrade for model s coming out that increases peak power by so model s should beat turbo s by a wider margin in 0 to mile walking on a roof is definitely no thank for helping grow sustainable energy through is great nice the fires are all too real true snacks hard to say with high but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess will launch astronauts to that‚Äôs significantly improved in current production my name literally means tree if you have car will automatically navigate either to address in to work if you‚Äôre home to home if at not sure if that‚Äôs in wide release but def in early it‚Äôs an awesome just a reminder that the full option goes up by at midnight on 1 for all regions that have smart order your car online at always like going it feels like going for sounds will donate trees sounds where are the trees being planted what kind of making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended we‚Äôre changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover etc very glass doesn‚Äôt burn melting point is extremely so much more resilient than asphalt or wood i hate advertising it‚Äôs hard to google solar links due to tons of ads go to to add solar to an existing roof for a new roof with integrated we don‚Äôt make much money on this so actually means a lot if you‚Äôre directly affected by wildfire power is reducing prices by as of today apologies to those waiting for outside as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires so imagine if phones were gasoline total sales would be like units using being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the homes with solar sell for according to adding a battery is highly likely to increase home value too as security against blackouts is increasingly recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs extremely high will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters us clean energy incentive drops by on so orders must be received by roughly to be installed in time solar plus battery backup for clean energy no blackouts at sure took my son to play piano for the seniors home in it was lovely to see them smile thanks to everyone at who worked so hard over the years to make our factory sandwich time travel is the only explanation physics facts you can walk on the in if you want üòâ is team in general is the strongest its ever wight destruction guaranteed or your money roof will start at sorry for slight true transparent aluminum is a real that would be surfaces that see the sun should be alive with not maybe call solar roof tiles product like but will probably be a little bumpy at but then improve üî• strange to think that our civilization is only years if dated from earliest less than the lifespan of a fruit compared to age of to be integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement if your roof is more than 5 years away from solar retrofit is recommended time this product may appear but actually difficult to get right will do an open call major incoming for sure i have but will switch to solar tile roof launch tomorrow at sure but actually super proud of team for great execution support of customers greatly - shanghai ahead of schedule - model y ahead of schedule - solar installs from - profitable - positive free cash flow the big rear wing is only on for one day for rear isn‚Äôt needed to set ring record won‚Äôt be in the production internal camera isn‚Äôt used yet for but that‚Äôs a good idea please about your experience and what can be improved coming soon it sending this tweet through space via satellite üõ∞ homes with solar sell for according to more less stick very likely that a home with clean power that‚Äôs lower cost than plus blackout protection via will have a positive effect on value says rolling blackouts expected in for next order solar + battery for clean power no going offline for a few days both at the same more about dealing with failure modes roll control need to deal with thrust asymmetry from of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair which would double thrust thrust differential doesn‚Äôt solve roll control common but incorrect and so begins the wins best headlights award ü•á the final configuration used at to set the record will go into production around summer so this is not merely for the track anyone who‚Äôs interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing ‚Äî designing building the machine that makes the machine ‚Äî please consider working at or we‚Äôre gonna take this to a whole new team has done an incredible job with honored to work with in so much respect for those doing high volume it‚Äôs insanely but you make a real thing that people my hat is off to you is first car company to achieve sustained volume production in past most painful thing ever been including getting falcon to prototypes are but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard and the lead character is also named woody engines at min throttle for so most of impulse goes through vac engines conservation of energy tells you the answer looking forward to we def could be wrong about but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place only thrust vector engines with smaller don‚Äôt need a lot of room moment of inertia is much we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire raptor vac at sea level without flow so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table couple but of raptor vac is as optimized for speed of maybe to max thrust version of raptor should achieve true target is ton engine with max version should achieve but probably due to big these are just guesses for effect is not well value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple one of the reasons we favor over this is all that matters is number used in propellant residuals are incredibly often overwhelming engine big challenge for refueling on the moon is finding sources of probably some pretty big deposits in craters from same goes for hydrogen also in we‚Äôre working on a simple initial version of will be but sometimes park in silly places that aren‚Äôt actual parking great to be r is distance from center of masses of two center of mass of earth is so gravity change is small at space station which is from center of and you can on the since it has no most people aren‚Äôt aware that orbit is all about horizontal not a spacecraft needs to travel about times the speed of sound to stay in will be raptor vertical test hopefully allows simplification of raptor as pump shaft wear drainage is better in vertical more of test as you fly software yes will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon would be very difficult true we will it is actually called deep as sort of a joke at takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when how fast to move the deep neural net coming we‚Äôre not trademarking any other autopilot neural just this because rain is good catch hot pot doesn‚Äôt look like anything seen bouncing around the it‚Äôs closer to an armored personnel carrier from the those rumors are false coming v soon chief tree space jam should‚Äôve won the recommended for both movies are first will godfather part then space jam underappreciated will is space jam so it goes sure looks that way nice solar depends on total system efficiency how long the propellant plant can run to refill so 1 to as a rough guess that does look fair will hold on price change until gets clarity from regulators about smart summon feature release french fries üçü are the devil üòà are you aware that one of your senior journalists is openly funding a fake charity run by an online super messed up several finesse improvements coming to smart summon in coming will be smooth as should be much better at this point price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced to help those affected by blackouts but probably a year or two lot of fish to fry cannot continue to lose to achieve our goal of environmental must be financially sustainable or we will cease to allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid v pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net for the homeowner or will take the panels adding negatively affects but gives homeowner power protection in event of a when the car is without you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly cost by allowing others to use managing a small fleet of will be a career for many much better than driving a single putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well energy loss is fairly just north facing that‚Äôs problematic above deg üòâ working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service will start doing upgrades in volume in a few coincident with more features being still working with the car regulatory authority in unclear why there‚Äôs a other countries are now that with smart summon is full price will increase by on 1 get solar plus battery for clean power no more will be throughout it‚Äôs something special fundamental metric of good of is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future true i exactly also adding solar to our supercharger stations as fast as goal is clean power with no all supercharger stations in regions affected by power outages will have within next few just waiting on we‚Äôre changing storm watch to disaster covers more yes no change important for working on it even likes it‚Äôs really quite but we call it because it‚Äôs in a üöò software comes with karaoke üé§ yes a shortfall of gravitas next update burn ü¶å why is there no emoji for yes door hinge the color orange is named after the fruit will remove thanks for should be enabled on all loaner yeah not as requires wire harness changes ü¶∂ üí® in the credits worth reading by about future risks solutions all hardware is at the need to do static fire and reconfigure for launch probably late / early we had to reallocate some resources to speed this up received great support from our parachute i was at their factory with the team on sat and we‚Äôre focusing on the advanced which provides highest safety factor for for what it‚Äôs the which just reviewed in shows falcon dragon at the cape all testing done in weeks ü§£ culture class is really something i hope so we‚Äôre true done and that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg agreed good ones fair point any feature given how quickly the world is shifting to electric a vehicle bought today will probably have low resale value üí® üêê sounds too of will consider sure customized horn movement sounds being of coming to soon we will understand the next question true to understand the nature of consciousness it‚Äôs true exactly great list of hotel hacks in this excited about launching asteroid defense let‚Äôs go sorry it took so summon will get steadily smoother until it‚Äôs like an expert chauffeur who knows you welded steel probably üõ∞ some fun things by is incredible not will ask regulators enhanced should get it too aiming for this a month or although it may be a little silly at first not yet first point release update expected to go out this weekend over smart summon uses in first few team is the strongest it‚Äôs ever been doing an amazing honored to work beside if then orbit great summary of the key that‚Äôs about except no tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot have to be it‚Äôs all the structure that concerns not engines primary raptor cost is tracking to well under for goal is for is a ton stop sending me this üí© agreed such a heartwarming photo i have that exact thought every time i get the flu clearly a sign of the lot of ways to melt join mostly just needs to be welded consistently with precise thankfully is very difficult to get right not needed with production version will be a lot more polished than this but still fun to see bigger at rear also moves center of pressure back yes in solving for a good mars we will learn a great deal about how to do so on it is the inverse inside cargo header tanks mounted in tip of nosecone to offset engine weight at cool probably our most viral feature most of the autopilot team has been working on led by many good question üòÄ rage against the dying of the light we‚Äôre going to use the pedestrian pink noise speaker to talk to people create customized horn beg your but would you be so kind as to allow me to said in the voice of special light pattern not as they‚Äôre too seems right makes sense precisely to make life as we know it will allow us to inhabit other worlds halves being joined summon is improving rapidly just so but we use many developed by if anyone has that would be helpful massive engineering work in the printing machining of raptor ‚Äî far more than in design of the engine there‚Äôs so much power going through this engine that it‚Äôs close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places yes hopefully closer to bar over that the jacket has so many joints dissimilar metals at such high pressure temperature is what i find remarkable about we‚Äôve been focusing on production on only need bar or even a bit less for anything above is nice to have we‚Äôll get around to but not needed for probably around 6 or what blows my mind is that peak pressure in chamber nozzle is above combustion pressure at over bar or psi _ figure of speech back in reality media report was false raptor uses milled copper channels with an jacket all the way down three raptors on a always it‚Äôs been 5 years since we started at about a will include slight based on initial user we look for rare corner case issues with a limited release us then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory but hard to say _ you just started rolling out to all us owners with option selected in vehicle software settings more like anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer if they‚Äôre evolving something‚Äôs if advanced basic hasn‚Äôt been applied to manipulate social it won‚Äôt be long before it is exactly that would be a nice touch this is quite a complex but hopefully within a month or so awesome we could probably do that not sure we could go quite that but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at user‚Äôs discretion with rare composites would make they don‚Äôt stand up well to high but steel does ship is around tons dry tons but aiming for by or total stack mass with max payload is absolutely you‚Äôre feature requests always two one under each fin two provides redundancy for landing on unimproved on the transporter lifting lower section of exactly impressive work by chad almost entirely but we did have an for the java app for viewing maps a hockey game in turbo pascal mostly python it would be pretty embarrassing to use a this includes original engineering of new factory processes great engineers will only join if original engineering is not just is building a major engineering team in incl heavy focus on for factory car for sure more than one pass coming back to to mars could maybe work single but two passes probably could do but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling quite robust better just to ride your max temp all the way down let be your lower atmosphere cools you down real so not crazy hot after for reusable minimize peak for minimize total therefore reusable like wants lift during high mach reentry for lower but higher total it does actually generate lift in which is important to limit peak heating many powerful electric motors force required is as entire fin more about this on the that‚Äôs essentially controlled like a is doing more than any big carmaker to go the good of the world should come for what it‚Äôs he has my just sent a note to check some secrets are too dangerous to be free the trees and the forest it‚Äôs like a giant continued the veritable high priest of the harvest adding that he would soon have to rake his an activity for which he will most certainly don a cashmere hoping to open in most of eastern early next we will do proud by having his cars in his countries of roadster is def helping us out here with miles by itself ahem well um classified as a unidentified road object area foundry is used exclusively for advanced for incl our bottom half of at top half with forward fins header tanks probably stacks on three raptors already raceway flap hinge covers just leaving build site in super heavy rocket will be much like falcon but the ship is a strange combination of a üòâ approximately we also fire the to rotate the vehicle ignite raptors at full angle to complete the for it comes down to % of area moving vs flexible as to whether front or so long as within bounds of center of mass current which not fully bought suggests that 2 rear fins with separate legs will be so this is the plan for stability is controlled by rapid movement of rear fwd fins during entry as well as the smaller leeward would simply be used as a stability is not an issue with 3 nose tip has forward movable cold gas attitude control header tanks for composite pressure several large placed up there to balance high mass of raptors rear fins at the there‚Äôs a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the which is why we haven‚Äôt closed it adding the rear moving fins to in either sustainable energy it‚Äôs my üî• glasses üòâ have to do it on mars from will ultimately do that on earth so rocket flights will be zero net carbon next quarter will discuss with my product team next but probably yes great work by parachute the crew dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may the program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale a year old who has better reasoning more heart than the vast majority of political leaders that‚Äôs what life was like back in you have been warned it‚Äôs one integrated release fixing several minor bugs a regression in highway so probably early to mid next week much better chess engine coming well said very meaningful action by the company that invented the internal combustion people will remember this electric is the congratulations nice compression and of this but that‚Äôs + 1 = 0 for some i always loved this formula whoa cool summon will work on all hardware in wide release place nice this is not an onion article lane offset should be much better in yes told you was in other news busted a but this is mostly a design update for those interested landing leg frame yes glad you‚Äôre you never know exactly model 3 would beat the on over multiple as it has more range but very close rear but great for family i did a road trip across with my five boys in the 7 seat model s several years absolutely new roadster and x will come later original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 smaller the new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than it‚Äôs a we expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat model s plaid variant that goes into production around next i will stop by on the they‚Äôre available through the but we need to make them easier to find area of area droid absolutely feeling lucky or hungry are intended for max enjoyment of if location has destination that‚Äôs a but car should only route there if location is this will be hit miss but should hone towards excellent over great damn i want this service center expansion is at max so yes planning on meeting community supporters around the presentation on the maybe we can buffer enough of it will team that‚Äôs what we believe is highly likely i visiting in thanks for all your getting close coming soon oh that would be will mode is the best mode thanks you _ wise words from the bot we won‚Äôt customize the contract or engage in that just causes the customer legal bill to be high drag things pay for clean not it makes way more good you can order commercial solar in literally secs if you use apple pay at we‚Äôve only one car factory in one batteries drive in shanghai will do batteries drive units for the greater china over regional will lower costs improve logistics should note that these product mix logistics errors also results in regional right but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even the at any given moment in heads we tails buyers that‚Äôs not to say that people somewhere in the world are being overzealous possibly overstepping our core which is why looking into it at end of there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly global due to planning mistakes logistics problems is a big small changes in prices are needed to correct local the fundamental operating principle is that while they may will change for all equally should never be a function of this is normal for most but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the agreed going to early access all who bought owners in us next if us early access looks then rest of world early access owners following might be some delays in for regulatory there aren‚Äôt really meant to be just general price changes to reflect optimal value of as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to address shifts in tax overarching is same deal for looking into a fundamental premise of is that everyone is offered same terms at same what you get should never be a function of next year i think the universe looks great for billion let alone was awesome they used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your along the river in yes _ that‚Äôs exactly what i the commercial solar ordering now live at at least they had great cigars üëç ahem a is a with no sense of direction how you can them this is technically a autopilot active crash prevention keeps getting as we examine every crash for improvement then upload smarter i hope we‚Äôre never on the is fun makes it clear that you can only sense not velocity the downward spiral good point to carry 7 people model s at has 7 seats all brooks flux capacitor option package yes soon to be plaid is about a year away from production applies to but not 3 or will cost more than our current but less than no the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid a flock of bricks next year of course this could be good but we probably won‚Äôt try for best lap time this as we need to review tune model s thoroughly for safety on especially section model s is already there model s just set record for fastest 4 door ever at video getting ready for flight of design but that was an epic piece at a time when the word was being overrun by demented versions of an otherwise delightful jam it was like world war but mason jars love to üëç for will be answered on exactly _ looks good the mechanical attachment we need to make sure they won‚Äôt fall off due to vibration the hex tiles are actually mechanically which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any thing is a rope failure rate is actually both higher lower than as the falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several currently flying version has no failures fate continue to be but older versions therefore have a higher failure precisely distance from fireball is so if t is you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is at you‚Äôll only travel in pressure wave with liquid rockets is as ox fuel are poorly if you can fly out of you‚Äôre prob you know destination weather before departure there‚Äôs no weather in space everything happens so it‚Äôs such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to travels km in not currently planning for pad abort with early but maybe we vac engines would be dual bell fixed which means we can stabilize nozzle against raptor turbines can spin up extremely we take it easy on the test but that‚Äôs not indicative of over are but very difficult most likely is amazing sea level vacuum is but sec with larger nozzle for sure actually true titan and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest deep lore hoping to open in definitely probability that we‚Äôre in base is highly unlikely - wow cool why aren‚Äôt more people talking about sounds about right it‚Äôs not over it will be sustainable offer me offer me power also without the removal solar is unequivocally a instant money producing to per year after tax for the remainder of is permanently waiving the solar removal fee the ability to stop monthly payments at any time definitely for space we need to make very exciting to see rapid progress in there are always of but i think is doing great yes thanks for that would be we might be in one right now probably merging code branches one more release this wide release week looking smart summon is almost theater are ü•≥ for sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason wanted to build an electric car company in was going to do at in electric energy storage but got distracted for a few years by the years ago most likely we‚Äôre almost there doing laps at but does seem like a good track time is sounds sweaty üò≤ a could increase this by several orders of magnitude uh no ü§ó but this render isn‚Äôt accurate in some of even funny ü§î model s on next week cars are called not sharpest tool in shed um , this word turbo does not mean what you think it does looking into it and it irony still too buggy to be in wide requires more going to wide next it‚Äôs up to as to whether they go with rules or rest of not our except where limited by we‚Äôre aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this are working with regulators to in close poisonous gas spewing from the car in front of you goes straight into your ac good thing carmakers didn‚Äôt cheat on their emissions or we‚Äôd be in real trouble üòÖ nice gasoline is designed to burn anywhere insurance prices are high smart summon most both üçÄ and üòã buttons in yup yes definitely try should be less than currently only in but expanding critical feedback much opening on didn‚Äôt even finish his hypothesis actually true so exactly coming version at yes for very sorry for the delay aiming for flight in orbit attempt shortly update will be on anniversary of reaching 1 will be fully assembled by that probably 2 to 3 we‚Äôre about to ship raptor probably for next gen system would love but import duties are extremely even for electric vehicles should will u can order online at in 2 have car delivered to doorstep return for full refund can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 6 years since our first vertical core body diameter is dad empty one day will land on the rusty sands of mars congrats about to do next flight test dragon crew astronauts will walk this gantry to enter dragon depart for the with wings folded traveling through panama canal interesting not that i know of rather embarrassing impressively accurate hopefully next year appears to be a issue need to be we will try again tomorrow same raptor uses dual redundant torch better but more finicky in about 5 from flight attempt flight currently tracking to time for / hover test that‚Äôs cool oh behave u naughty planet üòâ üò¢ it‚Äôs quite robust where are additional superchargers most world‚Äôs first very large scale battery has worked out well last flight for if all goes it will become a vertical test stand for especially let your that‚Äôs the right future looks like flight may be as soon as support is much we‚Äôre working closely with regulators hope to clarify the timeline soon should be soon if you‚Äôre a utility or public utilities please consider using the better for the environment usually lower cost than fossil fuel probably within next 6 to 9 months is working hard to help stop global warming the nude looks like a wheel of cheese we need to complete internal testing for which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks wow everyone who bought will receive access price increase for postponed until version with smart summon is in wide which is about 4 to 8 weeks depending on how early access goes not risky can be essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to as mars is slightly too far from this solar system‚Äôs fusion reactor diverting a comet would be super could be done with small asteroids a mass but this is nuke mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial much like our this would not cause mars to become will probably make sense to do this when 1 has 3 moving body fins landing gear which is hopefully mid will be converted to raptor vertical test stand trickier than it may seem on as atmospheric density is that of earth gravity is but doable for localized warming might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites üõ∞ to warm mars vs artificial suns certification required an enormous amount of it‚Äôs mostly not would be great to get feedback from supporters initially model later y looking forward to seeing shanghai soon üòÄ amazing work by china team support of authorities much not yet this is a great idea um i ate most of it cookie decorating contest with kids converts about 5 million tons of mass to energy every second great wouldn‚Äôt worry about this particular but a big rock will hit earth eventually we currently have no don‚Äôt know but it‚Äôs important that the whole world transition to sustainable so we‚Äôll make costs as low as possible one click to order solar save in utility bills with no contract next year with the new lower it‚Äôs like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity still better to but the rental option makes the economics solar just what you think which means a small corner of with solar panels could power the entire united states 1 gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches earth‚Äôs surface in a few years legs are hydraulic pistons abdomen is the accumulator generates a of energy it is quite silly meaning less than a but this would be pretty decades the sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion yes not saying it solves mind but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction the trick is opening closing the spacesuit helmet really fast stop me ü§£ perhaps that one was too edgy hashtags are an abomination as better to vary thickness with vehicle but this is the right way to go for boring co tunnels reinforcement nuking mars one at a time simulations all the way down trust it will be hey fancy a hot date üòâ it‚Äôs not boring of soon _ guess i sort of am already _ play that game nuke this isn‚Äôt will good conversation with head of need a bit more hazard analysis should be clear to fly am talking to in a few hours stacking fairing tanks then adding control engines landing gear that was my actual password at one stop posting my password on coming audio engineers come from many other they literally our system is highly so we keep improving it via we‚Äôll take care of it corporate not yet ü§£ true no but don‚Äôt do it roughly possibly two weeks try playing in your at volume working on upgrades to sentry no plans to introduce air suspension on model 3 at this time watching a movie on is in large part due to the sound system obviously needed he would our first openly goth i think this is very i support yang when opportunity knocks passing like steam they look cool in a because our universe is actually a in a we probably just power someone‚Äôs brake will be needed for no latency is a challenge just spoke with so hopefully yes which aspires to be fully immediately reusable in super heavy is a truly even though immersed in design build 7 it still doesn‚Äôt feel approx min payload to mars to nearest order of so at cost would be doesn‚Äôt need solar but will work fine with both solar panels yes between and amazing work over many years by teams to get there for sure yup might take a bit longer to get through regulatory likely gas cars are so priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with we‚Äôre accelerating opening up page for more lot on our probably every 2 to 4 depending on how much progress we make video is amazing with the sound will include owners will get priority in the upload queue thanks for reminding will tons of software is real releasing to early access list soon ü§î pot kettle üòÄ don‚Äôt know enough about but it sounds like he‚Äôs focused on a machine vision which is the only general solution is a little but i like him he often has interesting things to say no sooner than a working approvals with wouldn‚Äôt read too much into likely to be fewer but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in thanks we‚Äôre working with regulators to improve spirit of rules is but exact language doesn‚Äôt quite align with navigate on autopilot working well in rest of but actual road data is what matters most what really matters is empirical nothing in life is so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of per good is great for fundamental structural except for front passenger occupant very rare these days for front passenger to be also but there are some weird headlight angle super inside baseball stuff well üé∂ strangers in the night üé∂ sure rocket fairing falling from space and really knows rocket fairing falls from space is caught by ms tree boat fairing video posting soon hoping to catch the fairing in a few race to orbit by both although a success by both in close proximity would be amazing each would count as a win details coming at update not in current but that may change no is great for polar will still play an important role but will be great progress by cape started several months but catching up this will be a super fun race to moon so much drama good times maybe worth a book one but would come at expense of üöÄ üöò headed to cape build site today just left build very proud of progress team has pics are of dome rotation

can request any service from the phone app in under a minute august either at cape or that was our last chance to reach if it had would have yes will also be launching the boring company china on this trip good idea you‚Äôre most fates loves irony for other we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of gives a sense of current rules in prevent but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future not will check with my told import duties are extremely high to even for electric this would make our cars orbital refilling is vital to humanity‚Äôs future in more likely spacecraft to spacecraft aircraft do aerial than a dedicated at least at fixing depot mailing dragon dock with space station is much harder than docking with our own ship for not a never thought we‚Äôd make it this far ancient times spooling up production line hoping to manufacture solar by end of this now available for energy storage thanks super proud to work with such great teams at and falcon rocket reentry from space with double sonic booms now that hopper has update probably in two weeks or falcon 9 piercing the sound barrier on reentry thanks for letting me know you can vehicle alert seen show up automatically enable single touch request for service for that item either from the car screen or mobile app system automatically selects between mobile service service center say prefer mobile in comments to we will add a check box for mobile owners can schedule service appointments in under a minute just using their phone we‚Äôre working on is high sure probably true depends on how release to owners with early access but hopefully wide release by end of august service centers a lot more superchargers coming to later this year will recognize read all signs for focused on traffic lights stop signs right most are very difficulty is millions of corner hoping to get into the of is normal but selecting would lower the volume of strident beeps chimes by if not will be followed shortly in a point release yes some not currently in but will try will include several games infotainment improved highway better traffic light stop sign recognition smart summon can‚Äôt you just play though phone we‚Äôre but the magic is in the final maybe 2 to 3 maybe not more than a few months feels just like an old school drive in movie but with much better sound when full is approved

at doesn‚Äôt need for coming out in august space fairies are real frank encounter in drone cam engine cam yes hop in a week or two flight water towers fly you can schedule service via the app in less than a minute good getting fixed probably to of that capacity would be for stationary storage launch underway i high due to colder than expected propellant thin tiles on windward side of ship nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option testing a possible windward side ceramic maximizing is best for nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very unlike carbon fiber or aluminum wearing black not recommended high reflectivity minimizes high minimizes particle no need to radiate heat away if you aren‚Äôt hot in the first as metal heats up to it stops being one space

super heavy with raptors i have the won‚Äôt launch structure will be attached to the other side from launch structure is being built in steel subsections 2 to 3 months after that it vision i suspect many besides will these won‚Äôt be and prototypes fly in 2 to 3 months made with rain coming soon yes service centers superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across eastern this is actually a good thing china is making amazing progress in rapidly iterating on rocket space station great no matter how one considers the there is a giant improvement from to autopilot that includes autopilot accident avoidance features matches curve of autopilot as you‚Äôd maybe end of next year addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more applications post test fuel but no major damage aiming for hover test next week big advantage of being made of high strength stainless not bothered by a little this graph is not as it includes autopilot accident avoidance features good piece i mostly drive model s performance with version of our new raven adaptive damping suspension is next is model then x if driving with my acceleration is fun on there is no only üç∑ üöÄ ü•≥ with anything online rococo basilisk security is extremely important sure thoughtful we will endeavor to provide the chips software to surprise is there a longer edit i can i think so something like this is the best way to do not about to go live not easy getting a into backpack approximately has area should be less to get to from you dislike you're going to dislike irrelevance even ‚Äî gen as mentioned earlier this cost of the option will increase every few those who buy it earlier will see the probably that‚Äôs approximately date when we expect enhanced summon to be in wide it will be lot of hard work by autopilot cost of full option increasing by on august straw man to your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for so probably is enough if you bought a will be bundled in all cars something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them we won‚Äôt be able since will charge a % fee for being in our but it will rise to whatever the clearing price otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers if we make all cars with package as any such should be worth to as utility increases from to basic white adds too much to service repair team convinced me better to go with pearl presentation streaming live from at pacific check website later starts around won‚Äôt be hopefully tomorrow will do this guy is not a of was at company but he didn‚Äôt work we are simple creatures rip um yes number to infinity and package will be hidden behind license yes but owner will have to accept tiny risk of those are very hard even for careful human that‚Äôs next after summon will trace back inertial measurements wheel movements to exit multilevel unless car was into in which case all bets are off single but hopefully later this year probably or 8 good progress on fast activation of summon down to second parking lots are a remarkably hard doing an engineering review of enhanced summon later it‚Äôs a but feature üî• i stole the idea from take note about but dangerously risking bad things at we‚Äôll keep it above for this more like to mt to plane change is as i but doesn‚Äôt as there‚Äôs no üõ∞ anywhere near that 3 to for true useful load to useful orbit including propellant for reference payload compared to other this is in fully reusable about double in fully expendable which is hopefully cont of main we changed the design quite a more about this in late up sideways for first hopefully up in a few sure raptor engine mounted on aiming for hover test great team motor trend awards model s best car of the year ever in their year it‚Äôs not a sure exactly the is moving at times the speed of sound orbits the earth every minutes absolutely you should be allowed to move your anywhere in the unless it‚Äôs prevented by government thanks for letting me feeling extra üçÄ button feeling üçÄ feeling üòã navigation buttons coming with next software whoop i think will would be cool if car took you to a random fun place traveled to by other owners in the area sigh the answer is always aliens nice i have over the years that was a real sign i actually asked not to write the book several some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for true exactly no no there is no model x or model s only a series of minor ongoing most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency model 3 rear drive unit as front drive that went into production 3 months this shampoo sounds amazing no problem the cape is one of the two build more on this may the light of consciousness shine bright overall aborted at sec on high mixture but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating so not exactly sure ü§ñ üöò üòÄ to be consumers will still be able to buy a but the clearing price will rise as a fully autonomous car that can function as a is several times more valuable than a car between first development engine first flight engine with operational there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware over upgrading to soon intersections with complex traffic lights shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software developer branch already mostly works in these but massive effort required to get to local supporters will be yes end of most likely production fully switched over months functionality won‚Äôt diverge until as it‚Äôs limited by software will be later for compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ice this is why it‚Äôs possible for to have a million by end of if we upgrade existing fleet of make at least cars all cars are to full capability with computer all production in past few months has computer 1 hopper agreed later in life is underappreciated listening to revolutions by found this on a throw pillow will do presentation a few weeks after hopper so prob late if that timing free chips for all my char was sounds like fun occupy mars üëç cat is out of the bag exciting progress in hopper almost ready to based on tonight‚Äôs looks like raptor vibration problem is is real when sheets come loose all dignity is lost model x as it should be shown what ants must feel like yeah landing on tree rocket fairing returning from space active safety will continue to improve via software since all cars are we analyze each accident do our best to minimize probability of we must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on earth becoming via it‚Äôs not clear how much time we have to do these but sooner is definitely best crash safety system is not crashing in the first makes a world of difference for pedestrians cyclists should be fixed soon reason for top rating is that active steering braking safety features of autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars congratulations team thanks to all the new sure good one meme of recursive irony not often these good way to spend time with kids playing a little gonna try w my death note exactly üòÄ order online at in 2 car delivered direct to home is this true ? based on i did years point for beating kerosene is high cycle batteries are just over but probably exceed in jet a has much higher energy density than but electric motors weigh much less convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines but still a bit too limited on that will change in coming years as battery energy density huge thanks to all supporters around the world helping the we tweak music car karaoke little music tool coming later want to add easy of images from your thanks for the happy birthday one there will be a little racing game in the racing game in the car coming they have the best such a bad public these do seem like wise words if only we‚Äôd listened üíï if you‚Äôre going to buy a be sure to haggle if you don‚Äôt already know what a don‚Äôt google you have been typing literally just me to we poured our heart soul into lot of hubris but no egg of hardly anyone but still we worked so hard to create that exact seat rails flush with floor on a design production of the spirit of st was so incredible sec mph is base model before adding rocket option that‚Äôs actually kinda true almost is much lower doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main you‚Äôre touching on a good critique of falcon our stage to stage propellant ratio is too we‚Äôre fixing that with that would be probably needs a restraint mechanism like space mountain roller would feel similar to space mountain in a lot of but you‚Äôd exit on another as all seats would be no pilot area or food galley most flights would only be to it‚Äôs basically an traveling at mach that about assuming people want pressurized volume is similar to could take a lot more on shorter that was our design approach in early but fairing mass is much higher stability of booster in ground winds is low there will be no block moving to frangible would def hurt presumably those quarter sections are actuated or control will be good to see splitting into 4 sections will have some but could probably sooner that would be an honor most it is programmed to do high entry force heat breached engine bay center engine failed thanks working on global logistics i know those are truly a work of but we couldn‚Äôt take a chance on stage failing it‚Äôs this mission was more complex than anything aware of in history of rip center you did your duty tree caught the falcon high missions will always be far value of boost stage is measured by velocity imparted to upper altitude is almost center core it was a long he was the real deal one of our main conference rooms at is named after it‚Äôs along the way colonizing mars one mug at a waiting for falcon heavy to launch means high cortisol this is our toughest rocket launch yeah heat will breathe life into mars i love botanical this is my absolutely that sounds i love the rocket spent many days there looking at rocket design uh oh on i like to drink my coffee in this mug is the of theory is his docile puppet will do orbital launches from cape at cape for so watched on hotel but still so beautiful just watched it from your link yeah the droids can now hold down the center core odds of center core surviving are about as it‚Äôs coming in about 4 times faster than a rifle bullet üñ§ software engineering üñ§ falcon heavy on all raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox fuel but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness needs extra swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó it‚Äôs a main reason is that is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket they run at higher but lower thermal shock strain are what fatigue turbine solvable for high but better to apply that engineering to same as last although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more could probably do flights turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or probably some seals bearings as coking not really an so cool anything with high contrast excessive shades of we‚Äôve been working on curbs a concrete seams so other rocket engines were designed for no almost raptor is designed for heavy immediate like an aircraft jet with inspections required only after many assuming instrumentation shows it using bearings certainly third revision of enhanced summon hopefully going to owners with early access later this week depends on destination planning on a simplifying mod to raptor for max but no to get to mt level since raptor produces tons of cost per ton would be raptor is designed for flights with negligible so cost per ton over time would actually be sucks yet another python possibly my favorite more than that but of that in although much to be proven full year production is usually of peak daily so at tons of raptor liberated its oxygen turbine to be not metal combustion so we need to update the design replace some production is ramping almost aiming for an engine every hours by end of for sure moon as it‚Äôs only 3 days away u don‚Äôt need interplanetary orbital synchronization moon too earth after returns from orbit mars belongs to the martians a accelerating development to build

to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical that‚Äôs easily most orbital objects are close to earth as shown by this density there are already satellites in which people notice of the won‚Äôt be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully will have impact on advancements in we need to move to orbit atmospheric attenuation is raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl which achieves highest theoretical fair super proud of one of hardest technology new high temp internal foundry needed to make it foundry iteration interval is weeks from design to flight part vs weeks typical for only a tiny there is enough air to affect the satellites allow some amount of yaw propellant stays but almost everything else fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of great couple raptor designed for so propellant density thrust increase up to as needed for up to improvement over doubled from but raptor is closer to whoa cool üòÄ yes beautiful solar sail is extremely gigantic has lights will be in darkness when stars are visible exactly karma bold move sending me this - great ad this is complete nonsense a car being electric to full maximizes future resale it‚Äôs not my finest work ü§£ given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine their future resale value cars will be consumers are starting to realize üí® üåå üëç krypton satellites initiating orbit raise every no absolutely 3 to 6 months lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected thus existing road traffic another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot opposite is you can have of layers of but only one layer on surface first therefore trains should be on cars below but you get to your destination so quickly directly that it doesn‚Äôt matter pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going paperwork hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part la has a but most people don‚Äôt know about it that would no one will forced to take the it‚Äôs boring company guide to why tunnels are awesome safest place to be in an earthquake so so good same publications will attack me for compensation tied to tripling in value and imply is they can‚Äôt be the üêå still crushes wouldn‚Äôt be but might give him a run for his money next fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any will feel like folding space from one part of a city to this is simple and just works pretty much racing at in a tunnel under la fairing halves recovered krypton ion activate in about 3 hours to raise orbit all satellites solar array deployment coming up soon that‚Äôs pretty launch in 3 new s x are much worth trying you‚Äôre on version current is version it‚Äôs smart smart summon coming tower with knight is across road from looking at rocket part of the factory is being but tours will continue around the parts that aren‚Äôt will be used for rear cargo also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is outer engines are attached to the edge of the to give the center engines room to move turbines on hot side things in this but this is just to illustrate the type of our are have 3 things on pump side complex liquid oxygen is integrated with main combustion horizontally first flights would have so as to risk less loss of probably around so it goes 3 months 4 months vacuum nozzle engines are only used in vacuum sea level engines need to rapidly at high angle for larger nozzle leaves less room to move increases moment of outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to inner engines have high range degrees sure two tunnels about a mile long each yes makes no in order to grow the you‚Äôd have to transport vast amounts of mass from would be like trying to build the in the middle of the aiming for tons useful load in fully reusable but should be at least allowing for mass growth for surfaces high angle main engines for hoping for sec but at least otherwise similar to sea level 3 sea level optimized 3 vacuum optimized raptors after the got we dropped it to 6 ships at cape will fly with at least 3 maybe all 6 about to complete ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer boring company starts digging tunnel in 2 aiming to finish by end of the turbine also spins partially combusted gas drives the turbine which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer the spinning things yes propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite requires an inducer 2 impellers with shaft üòâ did it for the memes coming soon been thinking about it for a long electric supersonic hard hopefully in about days physics favors full flow good design thanks good piece on lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles sorry to hear will easy to turn one of our satellites into a debris collector yes almost testing it personally this yes also porting unreal engine won‚Äôt let us maybe so but it will be information not trickery does not advertise or pay for we use that money to make the product we def need racing game using actual car steering wheel sure of course portal 1 2 on this would rock would be great to have ! interact with games via steering wheel buttons controllers lots more games coming once we finish porting top secret it technically but wouldn‚Äôt have enough mass margin for a heat landing propellant or so not reusable no worse than production of a gasoline provided the battery cathode is primarily nickel vs nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless which is what knives forks are made because a produces no emissions filters most spores it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels sure i live air quality is especially bad near this is why we put extra filters in all s x even have hospital operating room grade üòê feels like something is messed up with apple news almost only ever shows negative nickname is hate ü§£ congrats on many successful and i am forever grateful üòã set of all math jokes that are actually funny is pretty small physics demands the impedance of because it‚Äôs not real what makes resistance complex is that it‚Äôs half glad it worked out congratulations on creating great open source literacy 6 more launches of üõ∞ for initial for significant coverage mission will be heaviest payload ever at if all goes each launch of satellites will generate more power than space station deliver 1 terabit of bandwidth to that‚Äôs about right probably start installing end of next month is is working on but focus is ramping build rate of through the any insights gained by one team must be shared with the but other team not required to use both sites will make many this is a competition to see which location is most answer might be is doing simultaneous competing builds of in cape a but you can‚Äôt count on lines exactly it‚Äôs a factor got season finale leaked his bro happy mother‚Äôs i love you completely every should have good art music creation it is no that not be my lucky üçÄ number more details on day of currently tracking to much will likely go wrong on 6 more launches of needed for minor for these are production unlike our earlier demo if static fire üëç on üöÄ on first satellites loaded into falcon tight exactly yes they ü§£ will try it we have 2 dogs 1 dogs jump in car no cat does experiment probably not truth how about is driving followed by the word several times in decreasing font by on how about being able to look through any of the sure that‚Äôs how i feel when i see dabbing . drives a across the loneliest road in probably oh stop üòâ but putting the word on a ball is questionable branding competition is results in a better outcome for we could have gamed an autopilot journey last but when we do it this everyone with full will be able to do it too that journey will have a diff age rating latest model s is slightly faster basically begging for it seen it coming turns out there‚Äôs more ways to use autopilot than we imagined soon baby time yes takes you to a big purple guy with a bejeweled gold glove i was just there about a month ago probably shouldn‚Äôt have called holding company systems üòî just behind the which where the gloves are he‚Äôs just but best to turn car off just in also was years fight song even though lease cost is i recommend as buyer retains upside value of car vs lease where you have give it back to model 3 standard with autopilot lease is at but lots of other we‚Äôre closing the loop on autobahn will improve dramatically in coming ultra they have nice pictures there are people not on where are does look like fun metal rocks one of the biggest improvements was fast leg version 1 sometimes took in recent hours were much don‚Äôt recommend though ‚Äî bad for health but no choice or would hope to reduce to hours next been wanting to go ever since that metal band won üíô my security car is called baby smurf the too euro click checkbox under effectively throttles via tight impulse width

_ needs to demonstrate more progress with but that will hopefully happen rapidly . support for with high the critical breakthrough for orbital has made a big difference will consider to air is human üí® sorry for the we‚Äôre aware of this glitch it‚Äôs but software updates wait for a policy has been changed to push updates like this over cell connection close just kidding but the paradox is

üêê sigh weird good question what should be developed on of were simply death by boredom naturally how many futures are there stop giving away free and yet people ask what could possibly go wrong with fate loves irony excellent analysis wisdom new book is üëå on mars yes damn haters on the moon our competitors do we don‚Äôt buy advertising where‚Äôs the might be boring physics is a set of compression functions for the simulation it‚Äôs pretty much the only this will mess with your sensors are for the just go open so true as sure as night follows day is a probability distribution in the shape of a cat any observation of changes once had a great named because hamlet was a great the only thing beyond ludicrous is that‚Äôs is neither here nor not as far as i know we have a big dog called a little dog called the martian a cat named yes quantum mechanics was harder than all my other courses but so incredible is a great but we needed a dedicated for whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer i think it will be something like much more productive to manage a fleet of than only drive one taxi tops for is just with a power hog on a separate problem is you can‚Äôt transfer data fast enough between computer so usable tops is almost numbers described by were max running our vision net we‚Äôre working on takes time to get all regulatory almost there for the larger us at least 6 to months for certain regulatory agencies would beg to differ 1 yes it‚Äôs just me so the foolish things i say are entirely my fault üòú only see about of no deep logic to those i but often just preparing for hover tests tom is still an advisor to but about 5 years ago doesn‚Äôt work on will heads propulsion but raptor is a team no single great work by china team supporting hoping to cover all of eastern this year yup everyone knows is a he‚Äôs not that‚Äôs will look into order page will go live around may 1 or 2 we will delay full option price increase until may for those unable to order by may 1 model 3 order page goes live next followed shortly thereafter by new summarizes new print cover story will be of course range will be above we‚Äôre ramping up service centers mobile service worldwide more like but varies by country due to big differences in tax considering as mentioned full option price will increase after may you can order online at like blowing twigs nope üòú motor trend on model s updates model s drives from to without recharging strange but true this require hardware can order online in 2 for home delivery return in 7 days for

long lasting battery + fast recharge pack swap it‚Äôs been suggested by externally internally aren‚Äôt there good ones maybe add a particulate filter on inlet is going to develop a electric there was a major change in last several everyone will do absolutely seriously how did you manage to get shamed into being by social media jeez every fire problem is those who only write about 0 injury fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their misleading readers into thinking have high fire risk when opposite is support super appreciated sad if true üòî when you read double standard articles about please ask maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt reality is a like most electric is over likely to catch fire than combustion engine which carry massive amounts of highly flammable why is this never over a million combustion engine right there in the car fires per year thousands of but one car fire with no injuries gets biggest why the double this is a real those who predicted would be dead autonomy would never happen are same people attacking today for month while ignoring major automakers years why the double almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars autonomy was between years never def wins on energy density by end of this about half a million will have full hardware computer we will make another half million cars by mid next as a probably closer to accounting for empty travel to wait mile penalty most likely over paid impact is for electricity battery wear cost larger range pack over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in alone anyone who did this analysis should interview at upgrading hardware is not important for a few months is that a real we‚Äôll let the loose on track mode one day that‚Äôll be insane is mostly correct comments so dark or maybe pegging on that too you can‚Äôt actually use computation from a separate as you get choked on the so most of the computation is high high but low usable worst of all full video all model ever made can upgrade this presentation is 4 hrs long exactly all cars made since either have the hardware needed for or are trivially will post soon it‚Äôs automatic full happy home planet full metal alchemy love that actual range is about 5 miles / 8 km past zero coming soon already have one the internet is insane never seen anything like is just trying to make electric cars solar power for a better future for we might not but why do they want us to my shield is yours this is extremely messed , what‚Äôs going ü¶Ü we are very tiny put water coating on dark rectangle just below anything hydrophobic from hardware store or service can do is killing it on i love your castle a winsome nice back to work üêè are

sheep üöÄ propellant grade kerosene jet liquid oxygen are but are not common shaft only works if optimal rpm is similar for fuel oxidizer my twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point like but rural switched souls with the museum of rural but just a simple sheep thank you üôè are you good with an absolute unit too gave everything i had to in it‚Äôs not a big charge to to you‚Äôll be at state of braking doesn‚Äôt because the battery is so car is less energy yes rockets are not yet safe enough to fly over land engines seem pending inspection it but the attachment fixtures are different from standard they weren‚Äôt ready in time winter in snowfall is so beautiful actually less crazy in person or am ü§î i was always crazy on twitter yes i actually love buying a car in that can‚Äôt upgrade to full is like buying a horse instead of a car in love just water with steel membrane wings like a we may be able to lower orbital reentry temp to degrees which would allow the whole surface to be bare metal will land on a ring of fire yes winter is coming thinking about adding giant stainless steel dragon wings to that tweet did take immense effort fair point production is now ramping was last so we had to switch all lines to make packs for which meant production was living off deal please support my campaign to as üß¶ at some and i should just a get a room just use this handy guide yes good interview by truth exactly how will we you read it true always thought that the fundamental good of should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport energy good small oil is a problem too but has relentlessly attacked with bogus articles for over a they can‚Äôt be chalked up to poor where are the pieces on coal that industry is times bigger than perhaps they‚Äôre all angels this was an utter boldface unbelievable that would write something so is almost as bad in general are sock üß¶ puppets of big oil _ is kinda very much there are cars trucks on even replacing of that fleet would require making vehicles per will make over cars in next but that‚Äôs a mere of or of global vehicle car industry slow demand sentry mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched in this case a corrupt traffic even doesn‚Äôt have access to the video unless sent to us by mint berry crunch poetic justice boring candy coming soon please stop destroying dairy in the name of all that is please a lot of people don‚Äôt know much about how manufacturing if you have peak capacity of actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than first it will be much less than impossible to predict exact production ramp there is but actual max output is it was physically impossible to make more model in due to cell yes all cars with autopilot or so of cars built to date your interventions do train the but we first verify that the training doesn‚Äôt cause other so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability yes there will be that but economics will favor initial purchase hopefully have the order page live before if will push price change out a bit not good enough pushing release by a few will be cell lines at are only at have been a constraint on model 3 output since no choice but to use other suppliers for won‚Äôt spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to will start computer upgrade in a few months something like that starting may 1 please note that the price of the full option will increase substantially over time coming this year lease a online in a few have it delivered to your house within 7 days for full is my safe word model 3 drive unit body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile current battery modules should last to miles replacing modules will only cost to cool on investor autonomy will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car uh it‚Äôs a simulation hello biography that would be cool to do one day other automakers change prices constantly substantially by varying rebates discounts according to negotiating strength of is transparent so if we raise prices in the will you cut a can‚Äôt have it both ahem order page should be live within a few deliveries start hopefully coming this year good point leasing now available for model 3 am basically doing continuous on this is they each have several nitrogen steerable team made on earth by humans yes recovered from but undamaged both fairing halves will be flown on üí´ mission later this thanks on behalf of we ! liquid oxygen the falcons have landed . team would be so honored to fly this for ! exactly upper atmospheric wind shear is very will have to postpone launch unless weather improves vengeance sure sounds like it probably something notable to announce in a few months i hope a cybernetic interface is ready in irrelevance or doom seem to be the three most likely actually true üò≤ found a pic first flight for falcon heavy block 5 means there is some risk of failure between to many good design improvements from falcon heavy but the changes are i first read this as making wind with üßÄ has already proven it could be done last no question could do this in far fewer than . copy üêà it‚Äôs better building primary structure completion seems on track for but then it will take several months to install activate factory equipment love great first name yes mobile can do it no problem doesn‚Äôt matter yet whether you have computer or when it does matter later this will switch the computers for what independent with each soc having two accelerators that can perform simultaneous calculations to protect against a soft error working through regulatory the full computer now in production is at about compute load for these tasks or with full redundancy time flies any user input counts car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel is to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion of lane changes with reliability it will enable video when parked connected to all superchargers will have free over you‚Äôre thanks for your great love to do that good idea definitely already fixed to make core more affordable that would be color variation causes havoc team is working on international versions super hard regulators around the world have different rules so just takes enhanced summon coming out in us next week for anyone with enhanced autopilot or full option precisely almost done are you on mad max this may be too meek for places like the la freeway radar sure exactly base will have same so core functionality also improves many different regulatory just takes latest autopilot update is rolling out to all us owners with enhanced autopilot or full international coming just lifted off hit tether max thrust of tons will be almost higher than falcon heavy demo mission last year static fire data looks good so this is first launch of falcon heavy block so we‚Äôre being extra launch date might exactly in this use autopilot for of their driven and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional hi so how many ¬£ would it just between stay positive üßÅ good point how much is ü§î i think paid for a subscription at least three but your paywall keeps forgetting this please fix your your content is but your paywall is yes instead of someone needing to drive their car they can manage a fleet of cars that‚Äôs exactly the what‚Äôs not well understood is that cars being made will be able to do that for just a matter of finishing the software going through regulatory will be explained in depth via live webcast on thanks üòÄ great work with stripe much told it‚Äôs looking positive we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in sentry mode is barely at will improve a lot in coming impressive analysis only external cameras are being used right so internal is not when it is we‚Äôll add a setting to disable internal it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of as it can see through side windows rear it‚Äôs there for when we start competing with people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the shared autonomy in case someone messes up your you can check the will take care of it improvements coming soon needs to drive best clear lane lines are just one great name üëç neural net is upgraded too in this it‚Äôs not just a settings totally phone app should have all controls that car center screen so your phone can serve as a complete completed tethered all systems glad you like sorry about the trouble helpful feedback for improving the this is way more awesome than it might sound night mode default brightness is actually too high should be lower allow below current making that adjustment agreed night mode with brightness is actually too dark during the this is ultimately our we will update our software so that brightness is always usable relative to ambient change your screen preference from night mode to auto these rumors are responsible for more deaths than any other with only one extra is not good to but great for changing hair f just someone in a üêø very that a ü¶ä is reporting on value may vary uh oh might be my it‚Äôs pretty yup some challenges with ice formation in the cryogenic propellant hopefully overcome what could possibly go no you‚Äôre so working on that car seemed so advanced when i watched that show as a knight industries two thousand _ and even tinier ones for _ yes üêú going all stores will be tiny have tiny cars meant to say but spelled it wrong ironic if ü§ñ can do what can‚Äôt they solid work by as usual yes yes seems fair some people use their hair to express i use twitter . making the onion articles real duck emoji final edit was on surprisingly difficult to address false positives with system would go nuts trying to wipe away which was we‚Äôve been so mired in production logistics for past really looking fwd to getting semi into semi delivering cars amazing work by delivery especially in most insane logistics challenge ever thanks also to many country city officials for your help this super coming no wow this might be my finest work duck emoji defeats emo g crushing disappointed that my record label failed emo g records comments are coding in emojis also true true the quality of emojis varies wildly lame ü¶Ü syntax sucks assert series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high primary purpose information system for allocation of human as value of even connectivity at my house in silicon valley like the movie scary but also but for sure the other way also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can‚Äôt but you can feel in your chest we‚Äôre going to side boosters come back to center core lands on latter will be coming in v hot so annoying that perpetuates myth that delta iv heavy or atlas v can do some orbits that falcon heavy this is absolutely would have to go full expendable for but that‚Äôs very falcon heavy block 5 has way more performance than last year‚Äôs lot of room to increase side booster load transfer max q without changing any block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently probably no fairing either just 3 raptor vacuum mass ratio of tons tons with of then drop a few dozen modified satellites from empty engine bays with spread see what‚Äôs not retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the which is an order of magnitude more for it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have as our software is more refined for anyone who bought will get it anyone who purchased full will get computer upgrade for this is the only change between autopilot going forward will just be called which is no change to vehicle sensors or wire harness this is v sensitive propulsion avionics remained great work by dragon engineering major improvement over dragon massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical earth orbit using a fully but lightened up with no heat shield or best choice for the ion engines are too we should send probes to outer solar system get high true color images of these strange maybe there‚Äôs an alien artifact out there super good point tax authorities tend to interpret things in their but it sure sounds like you could be will rare use but it is there are complications with prototype roadsters had this exactly super proud of autopilot it is one week either ü§ó i think for sure worth giving it our best would be great to have a commercial program to build a moon base that is so you only get paid for safe delivery of it would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the how do you construct children‚Äôs that‚Äôs exactly you‚Äôre no longer mentally fatigued after a long makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long good point hard to appreciate how much autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high center of mass would need to be very tightly but we‚Äôre going to skip that at first to avoid launch glad you like navigate on autopilot hopefully approved for thank will do ford has 4 in 5 years nobody but loses 1 intern it‚Äôs front page i tell ya fist at it‚Äôs possible to make a city on mars by if we start in 5 years take orbital synchronizations you‚Äôre most glad to be only when y is in production every car company is constantly changing but nobody cares import vat transport costs to be this doesn‚Äôt affect website order existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on this will bring them in to be midnight on so effective 2 please note prices on all inventory cars worldwide rise by on 1 about to be upgraded to chromium reset sentry mode options will always exclude home exclude work exclude saved locations ask off if someone has already won a roadster from a prior they‚Äôre only eligible to win the signed performance y sounds like a good idea how to win the boss fight in it‚Äôs but once you win one of the referral count resets to zero you can‚Äôt win that prize intent over time is to enable those without a massive social media presence to you can only win each prize once you‚Äôre new referral program just released why uh yes we comprehensive statistics that go deep wide me he was so loved report explains market manipulation can‚Äôt take the heat no exactly best to get a so you can power your house also drive probably start builds in late may or start arriving in winter coming soon full duration parts reached orbital entry temp of around kelvin falcon rocket booster is carbon which have low max temperature super heavy booster is stainless since it only goes to around mach 8 or moreover at high it needs no heat not even transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the needs to be ready to fly again immediately after zero no straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps testing hex tiles hexagonal tiles on most of windward no shield needed on leeward transpiration cooling on only some of the hottest sections full size we decided to skip building a new nosecone for don‚Äôt need what you see being built is the orbital you can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump combustion problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the called a gas that has to throttle deeper than the main working on regulatory approval for both and cape will also be building super heavy simultaneously in both agreed raptor is even for a staged combustion we‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each throttling down to is but going to would be extremely but hopefully not started rolling it out a few days always starts find rare corner case fix continue always many issues integrating engine first hops will lift but only first hops with one suborbital flights with goes against interests of all this is crazy if someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day that‚Äôs fine to be orders are fully even after you‚Äôve had your for a week reminder to buy our cars before midnight on prices rise slightly worldwide on you can order online at definitely down the once construction upgrades aren‚Äôt so crazy this causes some media as batch builds ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month terrible following but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so massive month over month changes are usually because of not exactly same as countries have different regulations we try to build in batches to simplify production might arrive by but def before end of summer model 3 partial permanent magnet induction especially with silicon carbide is so efficient that it outdoes two induction if we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin then range of dual might be but that‚Äôs a lot of in better to have with winter tires than with summer we appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy still get this question a even though has highest cars per person on üåè is nice to but def not required for about a minute we flashed a teaser pic of cyberpunk truck end titles from blade runner played after model y webcast cut designed to feel much bigger on inside than it looks on an incredibly important there was but no one caught it it also feels way bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside would love to be there this if definitely üíõ üíõ yeah to supercharger route worth watching revenge of the electric covers rebirth of electric cars in has footage before after we started production of our first the hardest joke ever with pie ü•ß it‚Äôs about coupling the collective will of humanity to it‚Äôs about improving the lives of those with brain or spine next software update will increase storm watch you‚Äôre it‚Äôs currently too checking into this plug in a drive to record video comes with which finishes validation this week looking forward to building a boring company tunnel in assuming to be operational by end of yes our prices are our actual software vary prices frequently by changing the discount or that would be great sure correct that‚Äôs the plan of course 6 in lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford prices revert to normal on this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak we are still closing just not as many as this basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores but then can afford only about half the price was discussed with exec team when prices go those who already bought want the lower if prices go those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write a so it yes those prices will revert to normal on too applies worldwide yes car prices go up next except for model order online at before then for current couldn‚Äôt resolve all the rights will add another racing game it might break software release later this week should make it better 2 true true probably rate of progress far exceeds falcon although they‚Äôre critical to getting is what matters for cargo propulsive land landing should be no doesn‚Äôt have same safety criticality as pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface most but this is contingent upon review approval best to use a giant brake aka heat shield no dragon 2 was designed to land using with parachutes as switched to chutes as due to difficulty of proving but dragon can still do üòâ raptor on way to will be mounted to vehicle next rd are exceptional thank you on behalf of we have always admired your thank you on behalf of the

go out tomorrow getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays updated software with battery results in improvement in fleet charge time we will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of in north make sure there are no corner case issues then begin those improvements are independent of supercharger power increase from to all factors charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case more than 2 for whole this more than doubles total supercharger system latest software improves supercharger times by up to for all incl original model not splitting power across 2 supercharger stalls helps all cars up to so true ü§£ extremely important net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold rejects motor heat to air when outside is but an engine shouldn‚Äôt count until it flies did play a major role very little power only right before you get to the you won‚Äôt notice it in if you navigate to car will warm up battery

you‚Äôll make me blush i lift a little is that was a so buddy is like an earth gap in understanding is that model 3 production this but will not reach volume production until mid extremely difficult to predict middle part of manufacturing yes just literally having toast jam while playing jamming having toast jam in kitchen while playing jamming by bob most excited by the maybe it will be too futuristic for most but i love anyone will be able to take videos i believe so that unveil is later this year slightly higher drag * slightly higher frontal area affects air friction mass affects

many people of lightning bolt right before launch earth floats gently in zero gravity crew dragon recap need to get back to launch sorry this solution isn‚Äôt we‚Äôre trying to make autonomy more affordable over this is the right thing to we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the will take a few days for system update we need a few days to update the if anyone already paid they should get it‚Äôs not exactly but it will come with upgrade if you bought enhanced upgrade costs instead of if you bought a before yesterday‚Äôs price you can have autopilot or full at half normal cost to he is the he‚Äôs going to float around in zero gravity super high tech indicator added just before happy just use a dryer high easy to install low explanation from later today yes base model 3 available in in 6 to 8 latter contingent on shanghai taxes import duties mean price may be or more above us exactly no reductions from here for it fundamentally improves quality of best choice for most people is standard range plus with autopilot exact model 3 in my profile pic costs before incentives takes 1 minute to buy online at i think we should do something will talk with team send out a note in next few _ should be peak power increase with march software release scheduled for march along with many other improvements everyone who bought enhanced autopilot will get navigate on autopilot on advanced summon i was being too obvious make the mars technocracy real phone no answer üò¢ some news yes stop censoring because it costs to transport to east coast everyone pays same of propulsion still very so only equivalent people right that will grow a lot as we enter it‚Äôs harder to design engine production system than in maybe active in a month or focus right now is getting to high tight follow distance in test exciting potential exactly printers are too high high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an can‚Äôt print this has now happened several something is broken with sec tom did an awesome job leading other engine developments from start through that were critical to great respect thank you i loved it i have great respect for it‚Äôs not in we should be very glad of the us justice sec forgot to read earnings which clearly states to how embarrassing ü§ó oh hi fate too meetings are a valuable use of there‚Äôs a üêú in my üëü ü§£ great meme review hosted by will smith true it‚Äôs designed to be way we‚Äôll see what reality has to say about lot of risk i have feelings üòú focusing on instead burns up over the pacific upper stage is except mass sim in place of it will get for sure by loads dragon abort including which is 3 around or so depends on when crew dragon comes that‚Äôs scheduled for launch next but lot of new so time error bars are high probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by dragon supersonic abort at least or missions for falcon will take over before the fleet reaches end of crew dragon high altitude abort test yes üòÄ highest reentry heating to burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing fourth relight scheduled for always liked it was the robin hood of reusable rockets are all we need to become a once we have a city on interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in has changes that should help to the first i doubt we‚Äôd create a ring or yes the max chamber pressure run damaged raptor 1 a lot of the parts are fine for but next tests will be with which is almost production would require vast amounts of no need we have a super free fusion reactor called the super money move is especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep you can see the streaks on the vacuum nozzle in flight videos injector tends to have hot cold hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates great engineering but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and city on we are constrained by the accredited investor but will think about how this could be done that was a bit embarrassing engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get for low expendable upper that‚Äôs true üòÄ was was but block 5 probably be called is something took about years to get they received still almost a billion dollars a year for even if they do zero us govt still gives them don‚Äôt know commercial üöÄ launch market share went from in to in despite massive subsidies to they have never won a fair competition against for several that‚Äôs the critical point for more payload than the biggest rocket ever but for less money per launch than the smallest without something that lowers orbital flight cost by humanity will never be a architecture is simpler than staged combustion or but it has world record for raptor has better but worried it may fall short on those two critical so true ü§° john üëå not limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket or is pressure temperature in oxygen whoever owns the early deserves a prize in delayed gratification that i still only own which a friend sent me several years don‚Äôt have any i have been chief at from day had i been our first 3 launches might have but i learned from those meant to say annualized production rate at end of probably around deliveries for year still estimated to be about won‚Äôt be long before they do made 0 cars in but will make around in cars loading in sf for the gritty truth did meme review last night with from also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown pics are so clear in that last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like was competing for some of same people as i didn‚Äôt agree with some of what team wanted to add that all up it was just better to part ways on good i had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering manufacturing problems at to not been involved closely with for over a year don‚Äôt have or board oversight foundry casting raptor engine manifold out of it will soon autopilot max speed is above speed limit off highway or on highway of course i still love you this is in addition to existing cabin overheat which come on automatically at high temps to ensure any babies or pets in the car are safe yes üéº it will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and if that looks speed up next we def need to add a latest updating - model 3 ranked most satisfying that headline is not exactly going to win a for originality probably a month or sentry mode became top so pushed that out a some sites maintained an almost daily deathwatch years reporting with an awful days later model x first to receive a perfect crash test rating via bet the other carmakers didn‚Äôt see that one coming but needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a super heavy will press tanks even in version very as helium costs more than oxygen on even though liquid oxygen is vehicle mass helium weighs basically i am your thanks twitter to air is human agreed sorry had a vital mission in now i am back true moon mars as soon as the planets align on my bedside table a biography on has center place in my study just planning on keeping the public informed about progress will be some along the but excitement is the goodwill of the public is critical to success at least cheaper very dependent on but confident moving to mars ticket is will one day cost less than maybe even below low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on earth move to mars if they yes this will sound but i think there‚Äôs a path to build / super heavy for less than falcon 9 close but not an extendable nozzle as that just saves nozzle diameter is limited by body much above bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen pressure of to definitely pushing the limit of known propellant was not deep were just barely below liquid temp at 1 in raptor should do bar at deep provided everything holds which is far from only bar is needed for nominal operation of aiming for sec with vac maybe if we get i think 6 where we lit main chamber several with only about secs it‚Äôs amazing that the engines held the record for so many excellent raptor reached bar exceeding prior record held by the awesome great work by i was simply too sexy for it maybe tomorrow just left now then in tonight to review service in exciting to see thousands of model on their way to owners in hope they don‚Äôt find this üòÖ thank goodness it‚Äôs not a i want you too baby describes for 4 secs booster center of mass is much lower more consistent payload mass to so still biases towards engine first entry the steel is cooled is one of the most interesting things about rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above kelvin on hottest parts of main body maybe around on which steel can is around for a mach so needs shielding of some prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads longitudinal hat to the degree it may need hoop stiffness combine with slosh the super heavy booster is only needed on so think of this as just sometimes it needs a hence super heavy engineering telekinesis vaporized some copper sentry mode dog roll out next week design requires at least metric tons of engine reached mt bar chamber pressure with warm which means to more with deep raptor just achieved power level needed for super heavy many unexpected challenges with cars coming through first cars will start moving out in volume we‚Äôre doing everything we can to get it‚Äôs a super hard both prices are shown right next to each other lower price is the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel in for many states in the it‚Äôs way vat of import duties of usually result in a higher cost in üíô mach diamonds üíô glad you like it spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite main chamber gaseous heavy duty spark a üí® of insane power üòÄ will although is very really impressive analysis by some engine use torch green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the first firing of raptor flight so proud of great work by we will when it rolls out yes at with engineering team getting ready to fire new raptor rocket engine soon only a matter of time that might be the ultimate superpower how model 3 performs on a long road trip openly i said how is this even _ payload will actually increase exactly i do like nonsense it‚Äôs yes next few days üí© looks like sentient choc ice cream just bought oh yeah whoa cool no plans to do would recommend model 7 logarithms üòÄ we‚Äôll tweak the alloy over so it won‚Äôt exactly be but close my past mistakes do seem extremely especially the ones where i mistakenly thought i was smart rocket mass ratio is about the same for vs stainless full hard at but latter costs way is tougher doesn‚Äôt even need still up to will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows mostly true cold gas will use body flaps main engines for landing so won‚Äôt need high thrust reaction simplifies things yes initially making one metric ton thrust engine common across ship booster to reach the moon as fast as next versions will split to sec thrust optimized preparing to fire the raptor engine at it‚Äôs very rare to find all to be confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon because of strength to weight vs temperature reduced need for heat shielding will probably make booster same as instead of like ship needs control across wide mach regime angle of attack you‚Äôve touched on a very important the

primary backup power to steering cool that this is happening on many looks like a good design by . worked on my cousin‚Äôs farm for six weeks around my i was so many cold weather improvements coming via software _ so tempting it‚Äôs like looking in a that would be so and my grandfather was from with some got to hand it to that‚Äôs a great awesome moose rough beta in 2 to 3 weeks feature has now been in place for 8 months these are industrial not recommended for use at testing metallic heat shield at we need to be better at remembering brightness the youth love em if test flight of üêâ goes well next will üöÄ to this actual tanks are fine is peak heating expected on about of for on rest drops below so no heat shield cooling at takes care of of the another reason for i just mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night fairing was blown will take a few weeks to stainless is better for high temp outer as it can take so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate degrees of delta temp almost ready to roll regulators just since it‚Äôs part of safety all cars with hardware will get it sentry mode coming soon for all cars with enhanced autopilot despite high outside rapid water vaporization can cause it to snap freeze block cooling coming lots of unique road markings signs in each when going to specific heat is more important than latent heat of which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water untrue roughly 4 to minutes for light to travel from earth to mars director of asked me about boring co building the new tunnel when we were at the . would probably save several yes blood moon over la tonight the zooms around the world about every is the safest car according to us govt testing i wish them track record in auto startups is thousands of us auto but only ford have avoided a similar scenario is likely in all wow yup good ending on it‚Äôs adding too much cost to the especially model order must occur before 1 the whole referral incentive system will end the customer referral program will end on if you want to refer a friend to buy a give them 6 months of free please do so before i think some of them should combine talent is spread too dragon 2 was originally designed to land with but it‚Äôs not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or so we decided not to qualify it for landings how many electric vehicle startups are seems like a is very thoughtful but this stems from a miscommunication by the la times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on but in this case it was our miscommunication the source info is raptor development is being done out of our in we are building the prototypes locally at our launch site in as their size makes them very difficult to you‚Äôre hope you‚Äôre doing about for a two way high speed so probably around plus maybe glad you like it yes la is so beautiful after the rain dragon from as seen from falcon comes home we are not yet offering the mid range model 3 in which there is a import vat prices don‚Äôt include sales and about in extra shipping but it shouldn‚Äôt add up to view of dragon 1 berthed with in the last cupola dragon 2 launching must be more pointy tho it needed to be made real hopper will do vertical flight tests similar to the falcon 9 hopper diameter is or about should be done with first orbital prototype around yes yes yes this is for suborbital orbital version is has thicker skins a smoothly curving nose test flight rocket just finished assembly at the launch this is an actual not a yes getting some regulatory may not be available in all going through final validation regulatory probably releases to early access program owners in a few it‚Äôs yes üöÄ autopilot engaged is twice as safe continues to make steady improvements _ def not yes starting on will no longer be taking orders for the version of the model s if you‚Äôd like that please order by night at good idea it‚Äôs an option vertically or no problem you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance i don‚Äôt think the law fully anticipated this so probably yes for a will use cold gas system with ultra high pressure air in a composite pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear it will be you can buy a online in less than 2 give it back for a full refund for any reason üòâ the new roadster will actually do something like this and now we great thread ü§£ shanghai will produce affordable versions of for greater all model higher cost versions of model will still be built in us for incl shanghai output is just for greater not north affordable cars must be made on same continent as shanghai production of model will serve greater china region aiming to finish initial construction this start model 3 production end of year reach high volume production next year looking forward to breaking ground on the shanghai good sign that almost no model 3 owners want to sell their will be extremely early flights are especially as there‚Äôs a lot of new to be this pic is all nothing falcon 9 on launch pad with crew dragon new astronaut walkway is great for uniform we used that for the vacuum skin thickness will

metal turns into a flare in those it‚Äôs embarrassing that need to use a engine on but that engine design is brilliant you def don‚Äôt want electric pumps on a rocket raptor alone need horsepower per that‚Äôs not a full staged will take us time to work up to that is a mad radically redesigned raptor ready to fire next we are just on the wrong planet for no on on all future products will contain either the word or üòÄ but single stage to orbit with no payload is add super heavy rocket booster orbital payload is only need booster on due to deep gravity well thick alone on moons at this test hopper is at full body diameter of / just not full super heavy will be full height we‚Äôre building subsections of the i orbital design there exactly for at supplier made to our for in our yes i will do a full technical presentation of after the test vehicle we‚Äôre building in so hopefully the only significant design element in common with early atlas is stainless steel we‚Äôre using a different

for with next tunnel will be made with should be operational next for join our underground reverse back down same roller guide so no skill tow or flatbed it out autopilot doesn‚Äôt need the guide they‚Äôre only there if there is a complete system turns will definitely be banked in are tunnels safe in an exactly the guides are basically just a a shock a costs a few hundred dollars in it would allow many streets to become parks and walking less more probably only need three straight spiral ramp latter only for tight passive lateral safety is required by regulators i think they‚Äôre might be able to build this into the tunnel wall so long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or there is probably a good safety you‚Äôre we did have a sim but it was so i didn‚Äôt include we‚Äôre working on one that makes things pop park and i know that area best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding if all vehicles were densely seated throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is but better to offer a range of vehicles let people decide what makes them happy a variety of like normal from a small car to a densely seated must be seated belted for high speed next step for loop is demonstrating high throughput at high target is at precisely presentation starting at this affordable mass but better in that it takes you where and when you to go the demo ride takes you in car on down zips through tunnel using guide up elevator at destination then drives on normal roads back to start actually way more way faster way more subways are but it‚Äôs time to upgrade to something all boring loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians cyclists capable of traveling safely at over at

this no need to it‚Äôs super easy to swap the and sensors are the dying to make a pickup truck so bad we might have a prototype to unveil next year yes love that people are buying a for the product even if they don‚Äôt believe in climate not everyone can be convinced about global but if an electric car is simply the best they don‚Äôt need to probably next month you‚Äôre there was a ton of footage with many people at that would be great to longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting we‚Äôre opening a lot of service centers next including will post upcoming city opening map this probably end of next year so true this is a very misleading please post the full transcript where i complete the actually had several hours of interview which they distilled to many stories could

ship launch to in 9 minutes us too sigh falcon fairing halves missed the but touched down softly in the is picking them plan is to dry them out launch nothing wrong with a little satellites üõ∞ on this we‚Äôre adding police fire truck ambulance to the neural net in coming months default autopilot if there‚Äôs no driver is to slow gradually to a stop turn on hazard service then contacts the looking into what happened it is so hard to move in you‚Äôre all yes no maybe none shall good advice applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar just below nose of should easy to do yourself or service can do we‚Äôre also working on glad you‚Äôre perhaps most telling is that which is partly above the arctic has more per than any other country on as the battery warms almost all of that is there is a roughly range loss for cabin cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow but range is also higher in slow incoming rocket fairing probably but landing itself is over the horizon you got _ three one of which is no no reentry not simple can‚Äôt wipe it prof is correct but the relative benefit is recommend more soc for not worth going below even is still no issue going to or lower true both your can function as a boat for brief periods of time one day we‚Äôre doing an for the greater la tunnel thought we might need a test tunnel but we‚Äôre just going to do rock core samples along that corridor update soon sorry boring breakthrough definitely after our goal is to make a the most fun you could possibly have in a car we won‚Äôt license it to that would be cool kinda true üòÄ never heard of it super fun software eggs coming to all cars before the romance toilet humor more video software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month yes this is completely based on what we‚Äôve learned from the test we‚Äôre moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under won‚Äôt need a second test tunnel under if you buy a without a test you have 3 days to return if you buy after a test you still have trying to buying with no test tiny wizard 7 to years artists creators of all there is so much to but if you love what you it doesn‚Äôt feel like work varies per but

technically we should be called lava earth should be called our surface is mars land area is roughly equal to as it‚Äôs all even when warmed up water ice turns mars will be about good idea to offer

to fly üöÄ tooters good one good idea coming soon shifting resources from sales to service for next several days should be next week it‚Äôs the first or boost analogous but much larger than falcon 9 later versions will two is the stage super heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape earth‚Äôs deep gravity well needed for other planets or renaming to we‚Äôre just going to accelerate yes supercharger which starts rolling out early next will also charge much faster supercharger capacity will double by end of next expect to be within range of to of population in all active it‚Äôs got enough load capacity volume to carry the battery pack our current pack energy density is about double that of original it would probably only save about to of all things in order of resource but not necessarily production as that depends on thousands of parts which are extremely difficult to forecast what really matters is time to volume not initial market apart from brief vehicle production is limited by total battery lot on our so it‚Äôs either get van gliders or compute from produce sooner or do all produce not a big difference to total vehicles produced either priority list is model solar roof maybe interesting to work with on an electric that‚Äôs a great we will absolutely agree investigating probably mid can provide for days using battery not but should be possible around major parts supply chain to should be if should be please ask service but perhaps in a few years good we have that state so can push data to phone just like super troopers ideal situation in no is that arrives at scene fast with service loaner will allow having your car picked up dropped off or using mobile rangers service vans if car lift isn‚Äôt needed adding functionality to phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps no upgrades planned for minor tweaks to improve reliability provided are radical change is no longer planning to upgrade falcon 9 second stage for accelerating new design is very delightfully it will alert service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level set air flow to recirculating mode manually raise blower speed to 5 in model 3 for best air air filters are smaller than so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several congratulations on completing the cutting edge boring company just broke through the other missed concert sigh listening to better now is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation transport sure hope this isn‚Äôt it is the

major focus on minimizing time from factory to new did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until we bought some trucking companies secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter probably technically able to do so in about a then up to skipping rail saves over a month for east coast all things it‚Äôs better to use single direct to owner just acquired trucking capacity to ensure model 3 can be delivered in us by if ordered by we will fight big that would be awesome easily accessible energy send me a would be fun to add to yes will try again next month congratulations thanks , much rest in the many worlds of imagination delight you created for humanity will last is he it naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic for as a pot of water becomes it becomes inert but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam scary sign of times to it will get mined hydrocarbons come primarily from decayed marine organisms partially from geological processes makes me so mad when ethical scientists i know are accused of publishing climate papers for they earn ü•ú vs their other but give that up to help but their accusers make billions by slowing down clean which is more that is true should be right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy but move rapidly towards sustainable means lower profits but will make them stronger we know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel have to use sustainable energy so why not go renewable now avoid increasing risk of climate betting that science is wrong oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far because people on the ground know more about what‚Äôs actually needed than politicians do but not hospital s x were designed to be proof against an actual requires a giant filter with separate acid alkaline gas neutralization not enough room in model if can help people in please let us model s x have hospital grade maybe helpful for transporting fair will top priority for autopilot being cautious for max please what you‚Äôd most like about your cool with similar track model s is faster yes would like to thank for joining the great very much look forward to working we‚Äôre building a ship to do supersonic through landing tests in won‚Äôt land for those ultra light heat shield high mach control surfaces are what we can‚Äôt test well without orbital i think we have a handle on propulsive aiming for orbital flight by mod to tech tree falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a

we can do it zeroth law foundation of i am not true or love jokes remember the future oh hi guys has outstanding engineering talent just a few which is mostly accelerating decelerating so underappreciated walked full length of boring co tunnel under la disturbingly on track for opening party will be very sounds like pure when i said i was actually speaking truth i was just a simple drifting alone in small crevice with 3 trillion what is bikini bottom fair that is how we didn‚Äôt even have kids back just little sea humans would later use our bodies to clean so wow that‚Äôs kids these days have it easy i remember when i was a simpler times they first movie i ever saw in theaters when the only existing life was a sponge although it was in the era star wars only had an must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low they‚Äôre honored to work with yes definitely they will be made to the exact same but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation partial presence in south end of next with broader expansion in recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions just major in north eastern china japan by end of next we are completely missing vast geographic regions in some to clarify the goal for mass market products is local production for local markets least at the continent this is critical to make pricing as affordable as will manufacture all battery modules packs at china as we do today in cell production will be sourced most likely from several companies in order to meet demand in a timely amazing results by at very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this together with japan cell partnership is producing of global battery prob 2 to 3 weeks _ v true cute bring me the horizon aiming for next week r but üêª in üß† makes 4 overseas east coast in half of quarter the car will work purely on with radar just a but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway we can make it work from very far is just for um yes maybe will make me follow laugh like a demon say who‚Äôs the pet now you‚Äôll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big car if in line of sight car will drive to your phone location follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on app advanced summon ready in just an software so will work on all cars made in past 2 years hardware scientists uncover sneaky move by gm for those this uses slightly smarter version hopefully ready by next a should be able to drive around a parking find an empty read signs to confirm it‚Äôs valid cool legally required officers of a corporation are treasurer guess i have to keep one or it will confuse the good might put that one back deleted my titles last week to see what would now the nothing of seems fine so signing off twitter for a few days don‚Äôt we‚Äôll make it right the on this will be solid can‚Äôt not going we will just offer those who ordered bought either back or free lifetime it‚Äôs a reasonable we wanted to make the awesome version of model 3 performance more but it was arguably too much too taking corrective action this is total what part of sounds like a sure we will enable track mode for all performance cars it was if you want refund free supercharging turned we will do we will turn off lifetime free supercharging and give you refund or free lifetime whichever you prefer didn‚Äôt you get free supercharging for current buyers don‚Äôt get that‚Äôs will require tapping indicator to confirm at when safety looks good after miles of driving or there will be an option to turn off but i will isn‚Äôt it worth it true autopilot drive on navigation going to wide release in north tonight not we just bundled the upgrade package into no problem if you want to return the but i think lifetime free supercharging is a good on of followers like even lame on good posts get lacks scale is but def has gems twitter account is because it‚Äôs not real exactly you‚Äôre earlier model 3 performance buyers got free lifetime will add that to anyone who bought on likes are rare criticism is so it‚Äôs glad you‚Äôre s is but rear seat folds down in model so bikes can fit in trunk hey that‚Äôs my good question you‚Äôre not reading my twitter i wish taking body shops now operating in aiming for same day body repair in most yes i would never i am a little not that or a making progress i said dankest not darkest actually cat girl here‚Äôs selfie it‚Äôs pretty hot deep i think frost secretly preferred the latter fire and ice flies like an but fruit flies like a banana love the bound to happen _ yes time love supporters so midnight my twitter feed _ then the hell with not moths tho send me dankest üêª in üß† fresh from my meme dealer there are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one model 3 was car in us by revenue despite no no paid endorsements no competitors spent billions on model 3 was product massive thanks to owners we wouldn‚Äôt be here without same how‚Äôd they around mid there have been hundreds of improvements to fit finish over the but no major step change in this are dramatically better now than in the only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose just did that to correct the front design of model the nose of an electric car shouldn‚Äôt look like a radiator grill get this question a so need to clarify that there‚Äôs no such thing as a other car companies do this every but constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every to simplify many model s x interior will no longer be available after order now to be sure of the one you model 3 body design could def be less most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars working on it that is correct twitter thought i got hacked locked my account wanna buy some and i own a wolverine order without test drive you get 3 days to return for else 1 day former will be in next point release a few months for drive on navigation we need to address differences in how lane lines are varies greatly by good point interesting this is a ~ ft demo first tunnel still set for pending regulatory under la mph | opening event that night free rides for the public next day pretty actually i think real opens the first tunnel is almost done twitter is dark souls of social is is good this game is my personal but i am biased towards space stuff coming soon turn on enhanced security via the settings this will require entering a to use the digital would i really let someone get away with using my name all this is my secret troll it‚Äôs time people bored i will not maybe phone as controller exactly coming yes reality is hard online doesn‚Äôt count coming soon no that‚Äôs next had to been done welcome i hope this is if you don‚Äôt like a for any reason or no you can just give it back for a full refund also available off menu for a was causing too much model 3 long rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so it‚Äôs kind of like the post same price for delivery to as the sf bay but you do get a free factory which is really fun to rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow we did our traction testing on an ice dual motor is but not required for cold just don‚Äôt use it‚Äôs a long range battery with fewer portion of the pack is disproportionately but we can get it done now instead of just released lower model 3 super simple new order page week or two love the comments too dog saves her puppies y you‚Äôll see tomorrow brings a lemur special circumstances yes üòÄ new summon will use the autopilot cameras aiming for next few months but this will improve dramatically over next several months all cars ever produced early will get improvements for free software updates is a big part of why a retains so much value over same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year just reviewed service locations in north realized we have major gaps in geographic sorry for this foolish will aim to cover all regions of just big within 3 to 6 insightful article by thanks really admire you i think you‚Äôre one of the best engineers hope you return to working on rockets one the upgrade is the computer with our chip i believe it‚Äôs months before it is in all new production no change to this is simple replacement of the autopilot will be done free of charge for those who ordered full somewhere between to be actual improvement is significantly overestimated in this vs is more like a increase in useful due to enabling integrated better use of discrete this is without the per my public that will give the car an extra order of still a long way to go model 3 motor gearbox still in good condition after driving designed for ultra high works best if you play games full screen use steering wheel balls for control it is actually my game on cars right now üòÄ what are some of the most fun games we could have on a classic is just the yes thanks for recognizing the great work of the people it is time to create a also love princess love your name maybe this could be part of a car version of go style game üíó good whole beer keg fits in model 3 mechanical logic gates comes with free nothing more useful in the entire maybe wise to bring it just in case üòâ about half my money is intended to help problems

faith in humanity is this is worth caring support makes a thank visual approximation coming soon glad you‚Äôre safe beautiful picture it‚Äôs hard to not sure a is objectively much safer in a crash than all other according to this is just this is incorrect at falcon on night with the base support of much museum in south bend punctuality is not my strong suit we‚Äôd be nothing without our fans because is obviously louder than üòÄ no such thing as a at or even a model our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for there is no it sure very you are right a reminder of why it‚Äôs important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power you‚Äôre most glad i could be thanks for letting me know about warms my üòÄ the physics of how achieved best safety of any cars ever when vehicle weight is taken into order is more like then but they are all very falcon has landed owner shows how well seats hold up after the black white interior is def best what city what model 3 my character sonic boom this won‚Äôt be two ‚Äî one for üëΩ üëæ millions of years from now and one for you yes but üêª in üß† that we‚Äôre creating a generalized autonomy must work in millions of strange üöò blade runner ‚Äî edition ‚Äî it‚Äôs 1 of 3 forward cameras in rear view mirror external cameras will in future if car is damaged while fair point üòÄ when something sounds too good to be it usually way the trick works is companies like keep up to of short interest but suffer almost none of equity as they‚Äôre just made in short lending last not shorting applied to market as a whole is net negative ‚Äî it negative it stops private companies from going preventing access by retirement funds small thus increasing wealth moving to wide release holding back autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for that works well only if they‚Äôre extremely tiny we don‚Äôt any pic you owners can refer someone to buy a get any image they want laser etched in glass sent to deep space for millions of years rococo basilisk is first falcon 9 land landing mission from air force base in coming up the of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam the big funds can as they‚Äôre suffering a net index managers like pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for index if applied to individual stocks selectively but false if applied broadly to most of the market without clear consent of the shareholder where this breaks down is in passive index which constitute most of the the holders of those mostly small investors retirement don‚Äôt realize that their stocks are being lent to short diminishing their true equity there is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to as it dilutes the shareholder base gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means including regulators i hope to be less wrong over time you‚Äôre most hope to do more to help in the what they do should be illegal the last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned are value should definitely be by taking publicly available selling model 3 actually outsold by a factor of two this is amazing almost we expanded the early access program to more users a few days people sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make so long as it makes great it will have great if you think is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash hang in if you are truly it will be true sorry about the that was why would they be upset about their it‚Äôs what they just want to that the enrichment commission is doing incredible and the name change is so on great verdict üòÄ could be worse üòá autopilot team is got to make sure we iron out the details long tail of tricky edge important to get front wide b pillar side repeater camera neural nets just something especially weird going on with yahoo news feed on stocks almost always super maybe getting naughty by nature üòâ will definitely moving heavily towards direct to delivery of will deliver your car to this is the the way it should that was intense will take and remember huge thank you to all supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the you sorry for difficulties delivering your due to high critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run you‚Äôre sorry for the what would be great is original elite going over final tweaks hopefully in wide release end of owners increased tire pressure improves if you have performance they are better but slightly lower üòÄ we‚Äôre upgrading our logistics but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate tricky one thanks for offering to the coming week is incredibly if any current owners who‚Äôd like to help educate new owners could head to delivery centers during midday on on that would be super probably for a base to be built mars base alpha consider an ice same but much faster with arms in vs arms same principle is true for a front vs rear wheel weight though commonly isn't the right you can have on on rear still have poor handling if mass elements are far from dumbbell mass distribution is spinning is simple explanation of polar moment of inertia other important car terms at key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia of mass around of a to the extent of our is better than any other production this positively affects handling driving extremely important a car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car when it comes to make sure newton is on your side helps improve forward crumple zone especially important in high speed frontal and moments of inertia in side impacts piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details all 5 star are the as the videos just means a car met a certain but injury probability stats tell you by how true . will post final safety probability stats model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever glad they‚Äôre physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality but with room to add more down the kinda have if there is no a simulation probably wouldn‚Äôt spend computing power on sound yes true üòÄ to conserve computing a simulation would only render an object when it is observed you‚Äôre most sorry for the will love space bar there will be thousands and millions of missions anyone will be able to go should be active by then so many moon mission will be in high def so it‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre there in minus a few seconds for speed of light perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to there will be no obligation to do very close üòÄ always yes that‚Äôs the first barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material yeah that‚Äôs exactly how i however it i just hope it thanks for helping fund a rocket spaceship that could take humanity beyond hanging out with before the moon mission announcement will be bringing 8 artists cultural figures with him on the journey around the probably alpha build albeit a beta will improve with good news on this engineering rallied this will be part of going through final testing thank you for your trust in the greatly will be interesting to see how this evolves over time will see what we can really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as it‚Äôs not sustainable very interesting due to some owners encountering system issues the free supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night this is definitely worth thoughtful what might we do differently to improve i do top priority is and will remain supporting crewed spaceflight and national security missions can‚Äôt emphasize enough how would not be where it is today without . thank with lasers my tweet ever if you can help get rid of the annoying scam that would be much appreciated maybe the scammers will just get tired of winning eventually good they are there in the flight but we forgot to put them in this forward moving wing üòâ we‚Äôve gone from production hell to delivery logistics but this problem is far more we‚Äôre making rapid should be solved awesome üòé design has been changed so the üöÄ lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three two of which actuate for pitch it‚Äôs not really sustainable at volume production doesn‚Äôt optimal we probably should have ended this yes that‚Äôs our service parts supply in general will be the top priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few outside repair shops are jack of all which means supporting of makes collision repair specializes in having all parts in stock not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of goal is for repaired car to be better than before should always be true if parts are correctly replaced with newer exciting to see some collision repair operations already completing within aiming for same day then under an is bringing most collision repairs as outside firms take weeks to months for driving owners crazy true owners can grant free supercharging for life to a friend who buys ends tomorrow hi the board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in despite many owes its very existence to this the muskrat is like a beaver with small but it has a certain quiet dignity üòÄ intentionally so electric cars made with sunlight yes bricks will be free if used for affordable housing projects yes first boring brick store opening in only cents a rated for seismic about to finish first building made with boring bricks in the shape of a medieval watchtower . will transport your car all the way into your garage thoughtful feedback due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in north customers may experience longer response resolving this is our top my am working on this exact issue right now best show in the service will stock all colors love that we tried every possible way to make red look without floating a special red tint in primary gloss but no we have to stop whole paint shop for red it looks like an episode of moving 2 of 7 colors off menu on to simplify obsidian black metallic silver will still be available as special but at higher looks cool not easy coming up with a good cover story for an underground volcano but i think it‚Äôs working our new boring machine with a üéÆ is about the right cell but i don‚Äôt recommend copying our current module far too difficult to like sands through the hourglass types of people in the those who understand binary those who don‚Äôt will do as promised not gonna die right here in the or just not on i am a business magnet good times with will add a fade mode with only essential info in august sales will be on at pacific on am running it in my but it‚Äôs not right will release to advanced early access users in a week or then more broadly towards end of much great is why model 3 is the electric despite no advertising or paid the colors white are red as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth complexity we‚Äôve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint quality in if need we‚Äôre entire sections of car or building whole new got to be can please insult me some best pr had in a ! i was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned v cool so you actually did nothing yet imply you are a the twitter name you chose is . answer the question . you brought it not did you investigate or if what did you actually at this i want even if it is a scam did you investigate at guessing answer is it‚Äôs i swear you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strange he hasn‚Äôt sued he was offered free legal and you call yourself great actions by twitter to delete bogus will increase usage by real for the my voice cracked once during the times that‚Äôs there were no sure i want that outfit the world lost a great man in john he was an brave and fundamentally decent human if only there were more such people in the this is why a small company with tight focus high energy can beat a big company without this is utterly fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that for will be renewable powered by end of next most people don‚Äôt realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil checks other service most major customers have tried it love now we need to finish production design build while avoiding dumb mistakes made with model 3 production wish it wasn‚Äôt so hard to be less stupid over time maybe this was key showstopper for me couldn‚Äôt make it even through expert fiduciary without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by current rules have good but make wealth creation harder for small the extension cord was miles but still what‚Äôs cool is that it was driven across the country alone escort or any accompanying using the existing supercharger network and an extension cord in talking to our public most were supportive of optimizing for value creation over quarterly this was also a factor in remaining it‚Äôs almost done yes looks brutal otherwise this is actually real this the vacuum tunnel will be a bit longer will provide some advance funding for student teams with most promising bonus award for all race pods that exceed half the speed of car karaoke hopefully ready in software update version just played missile asteroids lunar lander in really i was just cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught super appreciate fast response by fire no injuries or damage to goal is to service your car wherever you quietly no need to bring it to a service love born in the brain is more than true but it has only flashes of it knows itself too it criticizes itself so far from banishing it is itself reared only upon a structure of red and the so many saved so so dying to if you have suggestions for improvement after you drive it thank you for the thoughtful letter thanks for buying our would highly recommend performance it‚Äôs really good i don‚Äôt say that nothing will give you greater full no hard feelings if coming soon definitely is so yet gives you death by water didn‚Äôt it really makes me wanna buy rice read notes on the waste land version ford are the only 2 car companies to avoid i just got home from the you think this is an it is super appreciate free concert for during this intense great meeting makes great high respect for our hardware needs were just unique matched tightly to our model 3 review by unbox via missile command lunar lander already working in we changed the control mapping for max fun on a defeating traffic is the ultimate boss battle blue too hex nostalgia excited to work with silver lake and as financial plus and as legal on the proposal to take private open to it at some you did an impressive amount of work on this mostly even though i didn‚Äôt do an interview pose for beam good we will add this model 3 traction testing on pure ice snow great last thanks for helping make more planning to vehicle security software for free use by other car extremely important to a safe future for great will be a fun project for love the idea of adding a special item every few so whenever you go into a there is something new delightful to production design will be especially in we are dying to do but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of model 3 bringing y to market he was amazing not if you had a wide elastic at the top busted and thigh high socks with pockets for cards of course paired with what are your short short shorts coming soon to put them on post a selfie awesome ü§£ love this from has got all the and the other all the appearance of reminds me so of my who was very stern strict yet kindest of believe in those are the new design made of doesn‚Äôt need heat shielding or even meant to say same as hardware yes probably 4 to 6 those who order full get the upgrade at no it isn‚Äôt needed just for enhanced deliveries hardware chart by at investor support is only reason why this is not certain is that it‚Äôs contingent on a shareholder def no forced hope all shareholders will be way smoother less disruptive as a private ends negative propaganda from but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so no change shareholders could either to sell at or hold shares go private am super appreciative of will ensure their prosperity in any my hope is current investors remain with even if we‚Äôre would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with already do this with fidelity‚Äôs yes i don‚Äôt have a controlling vote now wouldn‚Äôt expect any shareholder to have one if we go i won‚Äôt be selling in either good morning üòÄ am considering taking private at funding maybe great work by . need the neural interface soon to enable we‚Äôre working on a new that can squeeze in an adult yes model s is def still the top but model 3 performance is higher value for money early access will have bugs but you never know for so would not advise early access unless you‚Äôre prepared to have something go wrong üñ§ autopilot team üñ§ everywhere much more interesting games other refinements will go to all x 3 from start of autopilot enhancements apply to all model plus s x made in last few years autopilot hardware or glad you‚Äôre enjoying model 3 thanks for buying a major enhancements to autopilot fun games coming in a month with yup def worth model 3 performance is üñ§ before i knew i was writing to the guardian thanks for the his attention to detail is the humans love the director also made original very tiny performance model 3 review by turns out even was shorting stock still as true today as it was 6 years ago squirrels will work with current definitely is amazing something like but more of an adults in cars anime vibe please send examples of prior work when looking for max if you‚Äôre into video game consider applying to we want to make super fun games that integrate the center touch phone car üòõ cool good idea thanks for supercharger trophy really want to make the car as fun as yup hoping to include last three in this with pole position linked to actual car steering wheel stationary we will try to squeeze it in what are your yes yes yes some of best classic games coming as eggs in release in about 4 thanks ! falcon 9 launches iridium to orbit from air force base will send a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult and most of remaining is we are tiny dust on tiny science oh see expert raise you a üòÄ body shops are ramping up aiming to go from days using external body repair shops to same day body repair with parts at service will leave any comment on actions in flint to those in flint can‚Äôt wait to bring to one of my favorite we should be really worried about this no model 3 is designed to fit adults comfortably in both front rear seats at same time we‚Äôre adding a camper soon to so your car can maintain air selective music power devices for hours or more while big batteries rock not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there‚Äôs room for trunks in front plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car hard drive industry is they build million units per year with extreme precision brutal great there‚Äôs a massive amount of on mars adsorbed into soil that‚Äôd be released upon with enough energy via artificial or natural you can almost any rocky yes we tried out a new delivery system using an enclosed trailer straight from factory to owner‚Äôs so super convenient car arrives in pristine condition without wasting plastic wrap was listening to singularity with but posted this instead have wanted to for so but that would be irresponsible all are you will floating if any formula instantiates it‚Äôs probably that think tweet twice 0 nothing is both real imaginary yes the future is accelerating üò± probably ships next summer side but too much load through center core this is thanks machines that go what‚Äôs worth another hope returns to he left due to relentless attacks from who constantly peddle uncertainty doubt about won the is considered by many to be the best car critic in the explains why there are so many cat videos localized field generators thanks for taking a chance on so many years looking forward to using the new iridium yes trƒìnd we‚Äôve gone from deliveries per week in us last year to it‚Äôs like hitting a square we‚Äôre trying to get rid of contracts should just be here you get your if you don‚Äôt like it for any just return it like any other never seen it so high that‚Äôs really thank looks but so many details need to be journey back from becomes extremely difficult as velocity altitude is velocity is only costs that actually apply to beyond will be it would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current wall street congratulations to all teams in the student to make pods that can operate in vacuum is very was great to meet overheat protection is always but you can also tap your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while model x 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked makes me very sad but also the fault is mine by far he‚Äôs a good guy always look on the bright side of life it is much better sorry ü§ó i love that scene i made that up they did not have phones during the french they used don‚Äôt make me bite my thumb at you for sure is calling wants its method of execution what museum do you plan to great underground power lines would clear up the be safer to have better save lives of many no kidding that will probably be its first use phew we had a drain block 3 months ago people are working hard to make am honored to work with are you trolling for fun or is it part of a what motivates i do you stand by your guillotine statement or literally or that has always been our goal this chart only shows globally competed commercial not us government refers to their skill at obtaining govt contracts subsidies vastly exceeds dunno where this is coming who knows about the but last week we had over and model 3 net we gave up some grip width in exchange for would recommend stickier tires wider on rear for best you might get sec mph or better with optimized rims someone has really thought about i wish his actions against me do not justify my actions against and for that i apologize to and to the companies i represent as the fault is mine and mine as this article my words were spoken in anger after said several untruths suggested i engage in a sexual act with the which had been built as an act of kindness according to specifications from the dive team good point i have never donated to a about of what i donated to , which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue reports that i am a top donor to are categorically i am not a top donor to any political thank you for fighting climate this affects every living creature on that i do not actually see the checks that policy a nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain i have given vastly more to humanitarian so that they are willing to listen when i call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity thanks to be i am not a am registered independent politically doesn‚Äôt mean moderate about all humanitarian issues are extremely important to me i don‚Äôt understand why they are not important to actually true hold up a mirror see if it fogs honored to work with an amazing group of people at but always happy to talk to an ace who might want to join safe to i in a month or so will check with our but i don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to like it spoiler next thing you‚Äôll tell me is they don‚Äôt like feels like a show tell i wonder what the cat dragged in don‚Äôt be too quick to that could go look closely smell neutral good yes wizard alien but i got feather of tickles wrote in joined fellowship interesting read whether you plan to buy a dual motor performance model 3 or take it for a test drive it‚Äôs like having pure fun jacked straight into your brain whenever you performance version suspension is lower has stronger brakes in upgrade package happy happy to gathering input this will begin taking action next week and let people know how they can help even have the could def make some pretty sweet in arrow form if you have cool you‚Äôre in will let you will call tomorrow they should go where their heart takes but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics engineering with my team after a profoundly interesting discussion of philosophy luck with vice president in excellent meetings with senior leaders in very thoughtful about the would love it‚Äôs been too prob early next year just finished an amazing 3 day visit to the world has never seen human energy vigor at such incredibly impressed with china team potential for the sure üåå üí´ at least it‚Äôs not the they‚Äôre basically next just between i have a teleportation to the it‚Äôs so true the pumps i saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave they stopped shortly after boys were rescued water level rose to roof level all way back to cave that was great sounds good glad to hear engineering team also getting feedback from the dive team on how to improve the design for future it will happen for should drive temp to why fan speed on lots of fake accounts on twitter characterized by high ratio to make it seem like many real people when it wonder now i want donuts üç© yeah good maybe use with work by you‚Äôre right on both most houses in flint have safe but they‚Äôve lost faith in govt test some houses are still will organize a weekend in flint to add filters to those houses with issues hopefully fix perception of those that are actually maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter for reply to my tweet with ppm test results will send someone to install a water creating email but in china so that won‚Äôt be working until please consider this a commitment that i will fund fixing the water in any house in flint that has water contamination above no great move why sir üòä it‚Äôs not just a syndrome good point can‚Äôt wait to try been a little distracted past few months on mostly but back at it and like a highly damped trampoline well it looked smaller on paper catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven so we made the net really big caves are now filled with water difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water little kids can in when but it can be deadly to pro divers when pump generator engineering team deserves some credit for the it sometimes feels like reality is a moral i suppose that is what religion tells wonder what i should do makes a lot of sense this reaction has shaken my opinion of many we were asked to create a backup option worked hard to do checked with dive team many times to confirm it was now it‚Äôs there for anyone who needs it in something‚Äôs messed up if this is not a good i think the person who attacked me on twitter will survive somehow thanks for correcting i meant to say over half a million please contamination levels of any kind when you test the water please results of your water tests when you‚Äôre there next are you planning to test water sources for should be very we‚Äôve already made around model 3 performance cars for test drives in exactly it means i created jobs for people directly through parts suppliers supporting people thus supporting half a million what have you already have the when used by is almost always meant to devalue denigrate the i wasn‚Äôt called that until my companies got to a certain but reality is that i still do the same science engineering as just the scale has good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous particularly if toxic gas or dangerous as patient would remain dry at std air pressure entire it was specifically designed to pass that point based on extensive cave video review discussion with several divers who know engineering is absolutely certain that can do entire journey demonstrate at any the former provincial governor inaccurately as is not the subject matter that would be dick who the dive rescue this is our direct great news that they made it out congratulations to an outstanding rescue just returned from cave is ready if it is made of rocket parts named wild boar after soccer leaving here in case it may be useful in the is so that would be i wonder what it‚Äôs like under all that a second one that is shorter is almost complete those videos are from this according to divers who have made the we also made an exact replica that is so that the entire path can be tested without risk of simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage but we‚Äôve not done anything useful it is all other according to divers who have made the this is capable of maneuvering through all passages tube diameter is arriving in about hopefully if perhaps it will be in a future thanks for letting us use your pool it is an honor to work with them with some this could also work as an escape pod in space i want to know who is running the mad it is both alarming explanatory that you run a psych ward diver weight belts wrapped around only weighs so easy to carry on long dry sections of then add weight belts for wet that sounds music makes things calms the adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio aluminum shell has high thermal so will be close to if ambient is a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of they‚Äôre prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold testing for 3 more hours in then it‚Äôs on a plane to design based on dive team feedback 4 air / oxygen ports front front ports protected by dual seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant proof to cave water i am an engineer tight control code is always c python is done great name story if i am a narcissist might be at least i am a useful one python pretty there is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to turbo c given airport soonest we could‚Äôve departed us was an hour but cave now closed for diver will continue testing in la in case needed later or for somewhere else in will even if not useful perhaps it will be in a future extremely talented dive makes sense given yes yes fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights adjust yes 4 points on front 4 on 2 air tank connections on front 2 on allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak in la working with the team building the kid construction complete in about 8 then hour flight to continue to be amazed by the resilience tenacity of kids diving team in human character at its got more great feedback from primary path is basically a submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of falcon rocket as light enough to be carried by 2 small enough to get through narrow extremely ground winds would high altitude ground it‚Äôs a can‚Äôt be too buoyant some good feedback from cave experts in iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to also building an inflatable tube with less likely to given tricky but great if it good idea prob wise to add an air tank end fwd to take in nose of pod vent valve in set air tank to slow bleed then no need for scuba mouthpiece or training unnecessary less susceptible to panic you‚Äôre happy that‚Äôs what talking about in that tweet ‚Äî pressure pod with other approach is a long inflatable air both worth you can put socks on your feet the same there would be no relative motion between the tube rock it‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak unless there is a very big if oxygen % is suggests that leak holes are not i would def recommend this building pressure pods with coating to slip by rocks rope tow hitch lead pockets for neutral cm testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done do the divers think something like this might interesting thanks inflatable tubes pods being made out of for better abrasion a engineer happens to be in is headed there could one of the divers need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube so long as air pressure in tube higher than water air will blow out water won‚Äôt come in does you know output voltage amperage of those generator 3 what will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick beyond only batteries will will prep in case boring co engineers headed to tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to there are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in looks like bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped would need battery air pumps if depth of is would need bar tube prob need to enter zip up then so long as air feed rate exceeds leak tube remains this is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes needs very little power as the work def of done is pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob to more have a small slit entrance exit in circumferential direction stress of longitudinal walking speed is around but if you‚Äôre in an air time doesn‚Äôt matter if tube diameter was a fast walk of would take or just need to duck for the narrow maybe worth insert a diameter nylon tube shorter set of tubes for most difficult through cave network inflate with air like a bouncy should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof to odd shapes like the a journalist who publicly expresses love for parties in with a prominent of any given company should disclose this when writing i know you believe but it means misled readers in her because that is exactly what she said i didn‚Äôt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don‚Äôt work for they just don‚Äôt like they were sent to me by multiple people on the i don‚Äôt use wrote that lee of was her face with in is this why did publish a love letter puff piece about cuff who took the not objective . posted on social media that she was partying in with with caption both these doesn‚Äôt sound very objective are right to be upset with we are having trouble expanding our service facilities in can solve quickly with mobile service but awaiting govt permission to do are you certain that stands by supports everything she‚Äôs why won‚Äôt go on record saying that she never offered anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of sounds how did that go true so publicly stated she for most prominent in her he is of the her articles print view this is not . you stated publicly that you eye to with the most prominent of have you ever provided him with material information about what a coincidence am not attacking all media or even all of . just asked if you inform public about an analyst‚Äôs prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your very simple to be , did you compensate or promise to compensate martin for inside information about did under that provide you with exaggerated negative which you but turned out to be , i just asked a simple please , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings extremely bad prediction are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their no one is in the car or controlling car is driving entirely by sounds very sketchy if , is it possible you‚Äôre serving as an inside trading source for one of biggest an employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him he sent you valuable in is this has published several false articles about including a where she claimed scrapped more batteries than our total production which is physically so of wrote article that misled public about model 3 production followed that up with mean tweet to me on my nice work . why did you mislead the people public about this . is relentlessly negative about they just wrote a bogus article saying s production last week was low by annual prod is set at built cars at our standard split last which is right on happy to support boring co has advanced ground penetrating radar is pretty good at digging don‚Äôt know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too if could fully charged and is beautiful was just there with my kids for a few hours to see the got set had dinner at a love the show and should be coming soon i will buy tons of your very early we had the ability to use the car as a battery outputting maybe worth revisiting camera onboard neural net should if very close will show up on will look into it i suspect that the govt has this under but happy to help if there is a way to do so you never know ideas corrections that could make a product or service better are always welcome yeah i like noted model that‚Äôs whoop whoop the spice flows no happy to donate some personally sure looking into will fix if 7 days team then what‚Äôs this wand üí° who likes short or at least the closest thing to magic that exists in the real world engineering is magic love space laser everything is especially sentience

when doing us govt crash safety the model s roof was so it broke their testing great since it will already have a it totally makes sense to add a utility pickup truck will have power outlets allowing use of heavy duty high power tools in field all no generator the truck will have dual motor drive w crazy torque a suspension that dynamically adjusts for those will be it will parallel park automatically have degree cameras sonar what would you love to see in a pickup i have a few things in but what do you think are but important nuances what would be seriously next is super annoying there are lots of who are actually huge but jump on every social cause but really proud of the fact that # of changes had to make to achieve even knowing about the was don‚Äôt buy our car if that‚Äôs a people should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them then you will really hate that scored four years in a row on equality we must aspire to truth important to read the wash post the to account number does not refer to actual lost it refers to calls not answered or returned in a day hopefully in release in a few months true we should always be concerned about the welfare of children those who cannot protect wherever they may but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan often inaccurate of the remained where they were had had run away and five were that left migrant just because their parents or guardians did not return phone calls after days does not mean the children are children were resettled by after the department called the parents or guardians to check up on but these calls were not required by and in the parents or guardians did not this post article seems good as we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic what can live on for long time is those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death hardship than those who over space travel will be safe open to this doesn‚Äôt take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million this is why a billion at so still basically in the nick of time from an humanity is not but it‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got could be very close earth is years old sun will expand to heat earth beyond livable temp in so if advent of civilization took it wouldn‚Äôt have happened at let‚Äôs find it would be

like active cruise control are not it‚Äôs a tough reality is that it will be pretty easy to bully a as it will always will prob have a manual override that requires continuous press for hardcore lane

with words i was dying to use the word working in the factory expanding the tour so many cool things to car factory has largest footprint of any building on maybe if you include all our sweet tents looks so when we paint cars red which rolls out today will be there in next release so big you can‚Äôt believe it vicious torque factory . good exactly what is my sentient thanks üñ§ at until late is but have to say that crew is pulling off miracles against all infinity the reality game that would be tricky to but maybe was thinking of offering an extended factory tour option where you could help build part of a car understand how they come i know it would have been super fun for me when i was a kid _ it‚Äôs called top secret yes when i was a i built model rockets my own explosives surprised i still have all a lots of built a primitive machine in but not sure what the big deal i like building if that ends up being useful work even we will add a to lower the alert apply light force to the steering alert is being changed to this try saying might work ironic if the bug report about bug reports isn‚Äôt working thanks for the will investigate sure it‚Äôs actually pretty fun building electric product is useful to other people good for i think that‚Äôs fundamental if anyone else wants to build this please do it‚Äôs a lot of stop being such a frank falcon heavy without something sleeps inside and seldom the sleeper must the spice must power the in thanks for coming by our car factory with . team was super fired up to see congrats on your that was over years thanks for believing in there is but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop from reaching its with the worst 1 in will have that‚Äôs still it‚Äôs kinda there in us with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn‚Äôt change even if you get a productivity should be because honey is a vegetable considerably less so than our competitors consumption tax is way higher estate tax better than gains probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not exactly he‚Äôs forcing function for any share monopolist to improve is weak a national govt is that by one may find lowish correlation for but that does not mean low great a little on the that‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating for is vastly better than any govt at allocating consumption vs capital allocation extremely biggest missing piece in public understanding of what tax rate of seems about below is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is outsourced above too negatively affects economic cool video thank you for helping those in need to be headquarters will remain in yup that‚Äôs lions

but i like all the people met from . they really care about doing i am one of the top donors to i couldn‚Äôt even keep the us in the but if there is some way for me to help these kids i will do so i think so i hope the kids are shelter you‚Äôre probably maybe after drama calms at the factory a pretty good workout just walking it‚Äôs they look beautiful will maybe do a media tour next team deserves this was it‚Äôs actually way better than the factory more comfortable a great view of the not sure we actually need a this tent is pretty line is in place at spooling up they super kicked ass they also poured the concrete built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in and it‚Äôs way better than the other line that cost hundreds of no needed another general assembly line to reach model 3 a new building was so we built a giant tent in 2 team love them so much you‚Äôre bad fiction writer we are which is extremely pro people can form a union tomorrow nothing could do to stop can‚Äôt even get enough to request a cause they have nothing to your union brothers you won‚Äôt find the books are all about no one is forced to join any good advice they have about three weeks before their short position explodes good already mostly working in the developer software can‚Äôt wait for the new season to we‚Äôve always provided hourly wages above union free drinks try to make it fun top ten hourly workers cumulatively received stock now worth to nobody wants so keeps trashing me via glad you teach that and critical thinking how not to be are foundational for all kids to i think we pretty much great i think essential incl health should be taken care of by other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people the view held by most of they started it attacked me personally search and very long reading great just means you earned more money than you spent certainly does spark this is a good thing extremely it has taken years we‚Äôre almost every other us car company besides ford has gone they don‚Äôt seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon wrote volumes based on less wanted to help transition the world to clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond those problems require a lot of you know nothing are worthy of the world is under massive attack due to climate change you couldn‚Äôt care read like the translucent martian iron pyrite congratulations to la times and you‚Äôre just a but i will reply i arrived in at by myself with no no father said fail be back in 3 i don‚Äôt want to see anyone lose their or i will at least provide fair warning before it as i have done in the you think all companies are bad and all unions that‚Äôs a very bigoted well said then you‚Äôll be fine our is actually shorter simpler than clearly doesn‚Äôt and wall street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at storm clouds are so they‚Äôre getting then look a little read the whole more the only prevents disclosure of proprietary or material information how big is your short just union are handed out all the time in the i know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda hand them to this one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and i endorse freedom to form a union as well as freedom not to do so if they feel is a good has major conflicts of interest failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in can only hire of so must be doing something doesn‚Äôt have of signatures needed for a they can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free they‚Äôre getting paid trolls far left shills to trash me in press social such not against all but has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world our current factory went bankrupt under before we took it don‚Äôt want to die i am of govt other should take care of critical needs of incl health rest should be companies competing to provide best product or

considerable confusion between wealth as consumption wealth as labor by latter anyone in govt whose budget exceeds is a government is the largest socialism vs capitalism is not even the right what really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people‚Äôs universal income will be necessary over time if takes over most human jobs was a he even wrote a book about a socialist those who

screen alert to clarify that we mean up or downward force on the not really the some very tough had to let go of good but i think they will find new jobs but necessary reorg my email to the company has already leaked to here it is that is actual footage back in the era when the main form of life was a sponge have heard universally great things about your of but it‚Äôs the kind of hustle that you like even with full people can read the internet anyone who wants a refund will get i predict basically the fun value is amazing we‚Äôre never going to make them trade is just that roadster becomes a 2 instead of a in place of the kid which is prob wise for many reasons total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs but power output is the composite pressure vessel is most advanced ever it‚Äôs what is qualifying for crewed extremely robust ‚Äî literally not recommended for urban environments yes the actual amount of time i spend on twitter is my tweets are literally what thinking at the not carefully crafted corporate which is really just banal it is amazingly hard to find a simple a complicated one is relatively love this simpler the add an r for roadster this is crux of can‚Äôt make system too annoying or people won‚Äôt use negatively affecting but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue a lot of people whose judgment i respect have suggested sounds like a good will do so after model 3 production reaches not tempting fate too much with that it was meant as a but is about the right actual will do pure wish orbital rockets could be so but there‚Äôs no escaping newton‚Äôs third is already developing high efficiency capture with to form liquid critical for propellant production at mars base you have my next gen roadster will be absolutely out of this for those who love to there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a rocket the air exiting the would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air which is most of the intent of new roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by no thus transferring the effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure that issue is better in latest autopilot software rolling out now fully fixed in august update as part of our version to autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on with we will begin to enable full this is why not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while i was in newsrooms all round the world say that if i only knew how newsrooms really then know everything‚Äôs fine no need for a media credibility rating system like ü§î

3 pedal covers different from turning on production for model 3 performance should be on renewable energy solar with some by next of solar already actually closer to but with larger inner diameter and we‚Äôre definitely going to have a pod bay door override lesson will also have augmented mode that will massively enhance human driving like a flying metal but in car form running track in bf

didn‚Äôt set anyone on a science reporter tweeted that i was i said that was are you saying i don‚Äôt have the right to deny false that‚Äôs messed you‚Äôve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that against then tweets that don‚Äôt represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too great read it when it came exactly has area at cape that‚Äôs 7 better than yeah second best answer to the paradox after the simulation argument which love their and the views are yes there are no at least you have so many great pics p first and then production costs are always high when line first gets so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative as production efficiency we can make lower cost versions not lose i really want to make this a dream that prob be a nightmare in cup holder that auto adjusted for size stiffness of maintained cold or hot temp dried off water or i work on getting humanity to tough literally had dreams about cup holder designs we can prob adjust spring force catch to be less are amazingly hard to get you‚Äôre appreciate the good school had a great time with my kids yes seems to be glitch where tweet to which i replied isn‚Äôt showing removing a journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by my response was that powerful people also own if you discount you should also discount thanks üòÄ superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region pointing out to aspiring journo josh who thinks public polls are controlled by that the media is by anyone who thought this was is just revealing their inner the context is very thanks for offering to i will check with my you‚Äôre these guys can buzzkill themselves signing off who do you think the you‚Äôre missing the point living in a bubble of the public doesn‚Äôt trust this was true the last election only got don‚Äôt believe run your own poll you‚Äôre welcome to come by but please stop assuming against all this is not something needs to be done to improve public trust in you really think i haven‚Äôt spent time in a spent time in too it had better critical analysis than most media deleted ? it should but dual motors mean increased braking will ride tire traction you won‚Äôt notice sport brakes unless you‚Äôre on a racetrack have the sticky firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard model 3 started rolling out should improve braking distance by ft for repeated heavy braking thanks for excellent critical model 3 performance will have red calipers sport level brakes keyword ü§£ üòÉ will do another rev before final design i was that‚Äôs what i had in mind sometimes even i think we‚Äôre the same when you take something that has nothing to do w gender make it about you devalue genuine gender about to holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or then deliveries check for _ it‚Äôs not that‚Äôs a great sometimes when i have hurt i play this song that‚Äôs the other guy so true üò¢ because twitter is fun dank is wack unless you‚Äôre on weed and could have anyone post an op of all are they choosing to publish this who is also pro gasoline is this just published as i assume does believe in climate but is the future is so is times that‚Äôs exactly but after suggesting public i was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their this is way worse than i the arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy well journo is outraged that public dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to a has a usable reserve of 5 to miles range even after the battery reads this will not hurt the pretty a b are both closing the link to ground w phased

video in when we made no one in the space industry thought it would actually generally higher quality especially if not under pressure to publish consumer reports is great often critical of heard good things about the information can‚Äôt believe someone leaked this schematic of the production we but govt is not supportive of electric vehicles will start extending the supercharger network to south around end of next year prob end of next year good we will add that to the construction plan global map of including those coming soon earth‚Äôs rotation is slowly getting slower you‚Äôre making my it‚Äôs tragic that there‚Äôs a national i wish i didn‚Äôt know all zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks model 3 was designed for min engineering tooling change for note for first half of next probably middle of next this is the new production line for battery module zone will play a key role in getting from to for model i have never attacked definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours was incorporated a year factory safety has improved every year is now better than industry misleading articles refer to being worse than avg in when we were just figuring things worth a shot of it is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to it‚Äôs called this is going to help not harm please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see problem was able to buy game on i i seriously didn‚Äôt correct me on something needs to be done to reward high quality some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the odd turns out is actually owned by for some didn‚Äôt bother to correct me for some didn‚Äôt bother to correct me tried to buy but said turns out they already use definitely did been through many press cycles know full well same person praising me today will trash me journos hound me constantly for but i do almost none these twitter as it allows me to bypass journo just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest yet believe that same public is too stupid immoral to assess their it‚Äôs amazing that you don‚Äôt understand how insufferably hypocritical that the facility is open plan we‚Äôre not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo i know journalists too well they are some of the worst best human beings ever you‚Äôre the no applies to everything therefore means definitely indicates because has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world products that haven‚Äôt been unveiled you don‚Äôt have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product you‚Äôre don‚Äôt remember but disclosing classified us missile technology to hostile nations would violate law land you in i didn‚Äôt review but my team obviously nobody cared about what your article done have a confirmed real name identity section an unconfirmed identity latter with that excludes probable be careful what you wish for the is vote is despite hundreds of articles attacking this very my point exactly you have in your that is synonymous with is great come on you can do get more people to vote for you are literally the the point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the they don‚Äôt realize how little credibility they actually have with the why are certain journalists so concerned about the public rating their all they do all day is rate ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have i did to any who asked that was obvious from a mile i tried to use their product it didn‚Äôt not exactly a genius move by but they were brave enough to say maybe after you get your model we can talk about what you like what needs to be improved but consider it we could unveil model y anytime from late this year to mid next so march is about i just made that because the ides of march sounded good gasoline or what car do you march the media hi open to right cranking super hard at the so it depends on how things are going next maybe the media credibility rating site should be called i do actually own but for the moment i just have it automatically forward to definitely there no good car i mean what the heck are these üöó üöô and this is the best one üöò yo that‚Äôs the basic idea for some this is the best felt in a hope you‚Äôre feeling good too i just tried to but you don‚Äôt accept when you you just tweeted about so you do thank i thought it was so obvious does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other i think you do great work if you‚Äôre in media don‚Äôt want to write an article telling your readers to vote against it ü§ó never stopped a union vote nor removed a abandoned this arrived gave people back their they haven‚Äôt forgotten betrayed that‚Äôs why can‚Äôt even get people to attend a free let alone enough for a of course it is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than millions more auto but somehow get less we are not but we‚Äôre doing our best to make clean energy real be a good they‚Äôre just some rich kids in who took their political science prof too seriously will do create a media credibility rating site also flags propaganda that‚Äôs why editors are included too we the media is reporting someone else saying that it is even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility the editors publications it is how they define enough of the public does care about the i have faith in the maybe some good people from those who would join not only needs to be but seek unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army exactly going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article track the credibility score over time of each editor thinking of calling it an exception that proves the rule this is how many characters do you problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks earn advertising dollars or get tricky as doesn‚Äôt but fossil fuel companies car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest the media has earned this but maybe there is a oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above try being truthful the public will believe you thought you‚Äôd say anytime anyone criticizes the the media shrieks just like why do you think he got elected in the first because no ones believes you any you lost your credibility a long time the hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the but publish only enough to sugarcoat the is why the public no longer respects them this will sound super but genesis oblivion i am not cool the one about to come out called so heavy i fell through the earth was sad to see g getting tons of undeserved flak because of so glad there‚Äôs some good too her music is not super fun right now üòî busted üëª none of those criteria are certain by but when taken together messages have an it almost always indicates use of a network of troll accounts troll dead not using real fake pics low account recently repeating same etc great will do it later this too much on plate right will be available as an upgrade from love original that would be interesting he stops at that‚Äôs when you drove gm into bankruptcy lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on just order your car with the bond option it‚Äôs an item for those in the know üòâ but ya know let‚Äôs test that maybe we do want even tho betrayed us 8 years ago left us here to maybe we want back even tho injury rate today is what it was with them wages were let‚Äôs hold a vote find in theory but not how they drove gm to bankruptcy lost jobs for people they were supposed to incl abandoning plant took over now it has destroyed once great us auto industry everyone knows we‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden eggs in x what do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch good point does they want divisiveness enforcement of 2 class that us fought war of independence to get of a 2 class managers workers be equal w easy movement either managing sucks hate doing it so more is overseen by most stringent labor safety org in they‚Äôve never found us to on other gm have repeatedly been found to fake safety that info is missing from reveal article no problem they are we never nor have we ever been scheduled to thanks have conveyed your words to the who have been working crazy really i didn‚Äôt meet with him i definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute need to have long uninterrupted times to can‚Äôt be creative just wanted to say thanks to all i damn well love have been meaning to get around to talking to some of his criticisms are on the higher weight he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other thanks critical feedback after you get the car would be much no matter how to be all model 3 incl early production will have same great braking nature of any is that if you care about you make constant small today‚Äôs model s is far more refined than initial abs calibration algorithm consumer reports has an early production model 3 now has improved ride lower wind noise many other small will request that they test current looks like this can be fixed with a firmware will be rolling that out in a few with further we can improve braking distance beyond initial won‚Äôt stop until model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable you‚Äôre making me blush not promising but we be able to increase model 3 performance power output a little complexity is the words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the model 3 production ramp trying to get to but we‚Äôll good we will do that for the bigger the braking result is inconsistent with other but might indicate that some model have longer braking distances than if we will address this at our first time we‚Äôve seen anything like even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing we will make sure all model having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers very model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance others reviewers have confirmed if there is vehicle we will figure it out may just be a question of firmware in which case can be solved by an software we can do the interview at in front of the yellow barriers beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt please send your meeting request to been for super love working with did for job security in last dropped like a hot potato to protect their core base in to exit this plant before even we had nothing to do with but everything to do with why people here have nothing stopping team at our car plant from voting could do so if they but why pay union dues give up stock options for our safety record is better than when plant was everybody already gets factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines report about forklifts not beeping is also these are both demonstrably but were reported as by we‚Äôre working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a pinpoint origin by acoustic signature triangulation crew dragon ship in chamber for testing before being sent to plum brook vacuum chamber for sure before snowfall this year it can tow far more than rated capacity will probably unveil next gen supercharger late major improvements all with you need achieve target rate then smooth out flow to achieve target shipping min cost model 3 right away cause to lose money need 3 to 6 months after to ship that means literally your mom could file for exactly that will be really fun shed light on what‚Äôs hoping to start that later this year after we become difficult to justify before was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that make workplace injury rate of our factory when it was w was twice as high as today‚Äôs about of incl salaried union were let go in annual only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened supporters verbally on social media lied about yes exactly they can form a union whenever they want there‚Äôs nothing i can do to stop is a very they just don‚Äôt want upgrade to the latest nothing will give you greater it‚Äôs like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at they are it‚Äôs second best driving feel of any car in the world apart from model traction control precision is super it does so but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell depends on when you placed your initial we start delivering the dual motor model 3 in three or four depending on demand we have enough for about right good idea that is electric motors are far more reliable than combustion you need an electric motor just to start a gas dual motor means there is a motor in front a motor in one is optimized for power one for car drives fine even if a motor breaks helps ensure you make it to your destination don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe cost of normal dual motor option is range is also takes to sec top speed to black white interior available only for model 3 performance initially due to limited parts will broaden over is dual so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks cost of all etc is included from cost is about same as but quicker with better will beat anything in its class on the dual drive performance model sec mph top speed mile range it‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to price to car but owner happiness is way so worth doing exactly will soon enable owners to request service from their phone with a few ranger will come to you to take care of your no need to bring the car in yourself zero about to test the then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight you can tweet to me get something in message boards that is the way to thanks for buying our carbon fiber performance black white ac induction front switched partial permanent magnet silicon carbide inverters in performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output get double the working on model 3 dual motor drive performance driving feel is aiming to release late check out life size pantheon coming but the boring company is right behind you at your speed soon will be start sweating he taunts us with his speed just an ordinary snail his name is he‚Äôs a snail üêå skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever excited for partnership with la metro listening to there are thousands of supercharger locations going through including that will publish an updated map in the next few yes will be presenting taking questions about the boring company plans for at on boring company will take you from city center under ground ocean to spaceport in to time will but so far it appears so it certainly needs to be better we work to improve it every but perfect is enemy of a system on saves lives reduces injuries should be what‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a model s hit a fire truck at and the driver only broke an an impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or it‚Äôs super messed up that a crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the people who died in us auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage yes according to there was an automotive fatality every miles in was every it‚Äôs not possible to be but probability of fatality is much lower in a we will be reporting updated safety numbers after each this is rejected for being not for fails to mention that is safest car on which would make article approx better than happy mother‚Äôs day love you so fair but we‚Äôre fixing it going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production looks lovely story if someone is trying to control us through complicated sky they must really i would gladly obey their but i can‚Äôt figure them will prob build to rocket cores for missions over 5 then takes over falcon goal of is to enable anyone to move to mars eventually outer good piece by rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get i like steam engines trains in i heard this so many in the it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing yo will make that a setting fossil fuels subsidized at million a hours a 7 days a week no use arguing with you‚Äôre that article was pushed as propaganda to counter study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be even if was combined market cap of is where did the other come ass üé© i have publicly asked people not to go fund ford or whatever launching in white interior in air suspension prob that‚Äôs when we making can‚Äôt instantly fill all will take months to do our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than which means has prospered in spite of govt not because of cap has over time as incentives how strange i love it but trying to keep simple so as not to blow up the production ramp will enable orders end of next week for dual motor starting production of those in air suspension prob next a cool thing about the design is that‚Äôs easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all already started dc to hopefully start la to sf next that will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels faster than first boring company tunnel under la almost pending towards end of next planning to launch in turkey later this love your country will be there in person for the this will work on entire s x even first production cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought all x s will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w signal strength is high you enable feature we will add that as a feature unnecessary will i wrote that masterpiece myself in thanks for the i will match the donation from my my a cover of paradise is irresistible quarterly love the shot of wild horses in winter so rococo definitely not a logo of

anything this chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels the artists only a small fraction of these numbers prob but whatever works is most people don‚Äôt buy music artist earnings from streaming are mostly about flesh without blood kill v maim on art angels album love too yes rococo basilisk the boring company will be using dirt from tunnel digging to create bricks for low cost housing i do like but she‚Äôs a we are not saying you like is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies warren is huge in it‚Äôs actually me hi then going to build a moat fill it w warren b will not be able to resist just for sake of what do u wish for in üç≠ what do you think we‚Äôre living it just occurred to me that the plot of willy is really messed up i am super super serious starting a candy company it‚Äôs going to be amazing this will be bigger i try so hard to help them thanks for letting me will sorry for the looks like sooner than the sheer magnitude of short carnage will be if you‚Äôre i suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit new roadster will have that definitely not it will be next these are really big oh and uh short burn of the century flamethrowers should arrive just in yup and once they were on the i should have answered their questions it was foolish of me to ignore we went through the same drama on s x and almost all confirmed in the will likely be even better for model as customer satisfaction score post delivery is i worry zero about just spent all night in the not the reason question about model 3 demand is absurd is that has roughly half a million despite no advertising no cars in even after reaching it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to the reason the question about was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the newsletter he received along with details in the body of the letter the 2 questioners i ignored on the call are analysts who represent a short seller not investors exactly it‚Äôs important to know that is the most shorted most bet stock on the market has been for a while please ignore this thread unless you‚Äôre interested in a tedious discussion about stock they were neither valid nor i will explain why on a primary twitter news is actually super model s x are producing major positive cash flow model 3 is about to do to be a big fan of but this is an important clarification the questions were not asked by but rather by two analysts who were trying to justify their short they are actually on the side of represented actual so i switched to you‚Äôre most welcome your numbers are is in world after a place will be largest when woke la la la crew dragon ships to the cape in about 3 months üñ§ üñ§ falcon 9 fairing opens its after reentering the

don‚Äôt make me use my space lasers i know such an market oh building a cyborg dragon sounds great riding my cyborg üêâ likewise was just listening to go flex psycho on playlist mostly not batteries are currently live delivering power at locations in team is working to activate several hundred has great rocket technology much would encourage focus on rockets cannot be competitive any more than doing our best now driving a model 3 and playing would be great to hear your we‚Äôre going to try a few can def be just about minimizing we already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in pacific w no islands or so upper stage doesn‚Äôt become a dead need to closer to shore position catcher ship like and then land on a bouncy house but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all mach regimes drops ballistic coefficient by 2 orders of magnitude will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon this is gonna sound but interview and factory tour with king too wasted to remember don‚Äôt want to brag or but that happens to me sometimes excessive automation at was a to be my humans are the economist used to be but smart with a wicked dry now it‚Äôs just boring will be profitable cash in so no need to raise demand has been higher than making them as fast as but is 3 to 6 looking into this is maybe a little üòâ got it she‚Äôs i love trolls has some really cool tunnels and bridges should be fully fixed within the next few days place your bets this is a very important action by avoiding a trade war will benefit all how many main body tool for the interplanetary spaceship free viewing ends in about 5 hours will take corrective action sorry about looking into it now should just be due to your not avail if not similar timing so probably we need to achieve with model 3 before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp this is kinda nutty for such a short so could easily end up being shredded but exciting either way upgraded pod speed test will try to reach half speed of sound within model 3 is the whole we only made the more expensive cars in order to make the we lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until the cat videos are awesome üê± at views after congrats to exactly are my but i am your ‚Äî in memory of hawking nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital watch new movie for free until night at movie premiering tonight we will add a feature to allow request of latest software version this is false it‚Äôs on most people don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs a whole box of eggs with every just tap logo on center screen easy access to most of discovered more coming i need to build cars about a year i asked to manage both engineering he agreed that needed prod better so we don‚Äôt design cars that are crazy hard to right better to divide so back to sleeping at car biz is hell can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre even writing about my job as is to focus on what‚Äôs most which is currently model 3 who i regard as one of the world‚Äôs most talented engineering is focused on vehicle we release as soon as we have the good bad doesn‚Äôt not just as asking sure there‚Äôs a really great answer policy is to issue a recall there are this is absolutely the right thing to yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last incl w injuries but you only wrote an article about why not going to do an fool‚Äôs joke about going if i thought there was any chance it would actually happen lot of respect for but regulates not which is an advisory releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately always to do otherwise would be oh forgot to mention it actually landed just not on what about university is a real place coming soon to free shots in stores every as you wish it‚Äôs the best was found passed out against a model surrounded by the tracks of dried tears still visible on his this is not a what's the happy new there are many chapters of bankruptcy as critics so rightly pointed has them including chapter and a half worst goes bankrupt despite intense efforts to raise including a mass sale of we are sad to report that has gone completely and totally so you can't believe important news in a few hours love seeing the scars of the rocket actual video coming aiming to improve the link quality so it can be everything‚Äôs better with fire best music video art seen in a while drat guided so fairing impacted water at high air wake from fairing messing w doing drop tests in next few weeks to is 5 away from being under the falling fairing have live attempting recovery of fairing falling down from space with our it‚Äôs a giant steel webbing catcher‚Äôs mitt superstructure on a ocean s house party for the autonomous peasant how'd i forgot my dueling dwarf while dressed as a knight and using a parasol for a sword turns out joking about being a star because of digging tunnels rock ‚Äî is deeply underappreciated you can upgrade although we also wrote software to accelerate rendering on old coming out soon makes a big from my every time i use i lose a friend and they said never be a rock star yes it‚Äôs literally made of rock the boring bricks are interlocking with a precise surface so two people could build the outer walls of a small house in a day or so prob may guaranteed to be first kit set will be ancient ‚Äî temple of etc new boring company coming interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures rated for seismic so super but bored in the like an aircraft wing so not new starts rolling out this should be considered a mature beta at so won‚Äôt be but will improve with the old we were stuck with legacy party black box code and stale no way to shocker it‚Äôs not a political statement and i didn‚Äôt do this because someone dared me to do just don‚Äôt like gives me the i have just asked our team to slow down it is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and customer happiness safety matter more than a few extra cars this you‚Äôll live we‚Äôve never advertised with none of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake product lives or dies on its own probably so long as it stays fairly i don‚Äôt use never so don‚Äôt think some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge we don‚Äôt advertise or pay for so don‚Äôt a how dare my fault for being an we did give them a free launch to make up for it and i think they had some looks lame first time seen one on the left looks will be gone maybe that word doesn‚Äôt mean what i think it does literally never seen it even once it‚Äôs influence is slowly creeping i didn‚Äôt realize there was will who‚Äôd say a thing like what‚Äôs a whole risky yes i them to come bring it no technology is too advanced for the boring that deserves a lot of credit for supporting commercial space launch while under massive assault from monopolists no real surface is but it did pull about lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel probably mid next year before we are able to make wish it could be maybe try a model used or new in the used s is better than a new 3 unless you want a smaller sorry ü§ó model x pulls a lb above us road legal semi truck on a pure snow surface sounds like this canton has you‚Äôre sorry for the only just got back from will be at our factory in the team is going all better to be in the model x the police are electricity vs diesel maintenance more than make up for purchase price the bad guys will def not that‚Äôs worth a lot maybe there should be 2 providers for advanced monopolies are so boring and mars this is creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to if it was about just do another internet this is completely never even heard of just taking my kids on a spring break trip to see ancient historical sites in paid respects to earlier live free or learning how to pour flaming absinthe over a tower of glasses in a thanks for your support over all those your cruel taunts cut me i love you oh you guys i find it yes good point that‚Äôs the name of my new intergalactic media exclamation point optional resist great my and i are going to do a cover of my little buttercup from the three it will be there will also be a plethora of q and sometimes even on the set with my bro why falcon heavy life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after there need to be things that inspire that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of that is why we did we did for doesn‚Äôt make any you can‚Äôt things that make them work without creativity it‚Äôs not none of the above tunnels because blue i guess you could say it‚Äôs a electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and a better video coming but it would look a bit like boring co urban loop system would have of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination blend seamlessly into the fabric of a rather than a small number of big stations like a subway definitely will still transport but only after all personalized mass transit needs are it‚Äôs a matter of courtesy if someone can‚Äôt afford a they should go adjusting the boring company all tunnels will prioritize pedestrians cyclists over cars heavy sigh is in finishing her second it‚Äôs about a future matriarchal with a will be at with who created made an incredible short reel of falcon heavy releases to be i think a fair outcome for all is quite china has already shown a willingness to open their markets and i believe they will do the right we raised this with the prior administration and nothing just want a fair ideally where are equally nothing hope this does not seem i am against import duties in but the current rules make things very it‚Äôs like competing in an race wearing lead no us auto company is allowed to own even of their own factory in but there are five auto companies in the us for an car going to china pays import but a car coming to the us only pays a tenfold difference do you think the us china should have equal fair rules for same import ownership constraints other every time an angel so thank goodness depends on what you mean by first production cargo trip of the semi heavy duty carrying battery packs from will have model x do a cover of happy

attempt to beam in about hours when they pass near la first two demo called a deployed and communicating to earth stations falcon fairing half as seen from our catcher‚Äôs mitt in boat no apparent about a month this was an older version so no recovery attempted missed by a few hundred but fairing landed intact in should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down made it back from space and fairing just now trying to catch it going to try to catch the giant fairing of falcon 9 as it falls back from space if you love drones above your you‚Äôll really love vast numbers of flying over your head that are times bigger and noisier and blow away anything that isn‚Äôt nailed down when they land not i let but it‚Äôs still i literally own zero apart from that a friend sent me many years that‚Äôs just random if anyone is the name was inspired by the fault in our stars high altitude wind shear data shows a probable load but better to be postponing launch to assuming winds are better today‚Äôs falcon launch carries 2 test satellites for global if constellation will serve least strange delta iv heavy has half the payload of falcon heavy and the rocket doesn‚Äôt exist i

the database has the falcon block 1 version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is block team is submitting updated not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine fix is pretty to support high flight rates for and dual ocean landings for side boosters no a shortfall of gravitas a third is under construction under we‚Äôve already stretched the upper stage easiest part of the rocket to fairing flying also has a slightly larger could make fairing much longer if need be will if takes longer than _ side boosters landing on center expended is only performance penalty vs fully cost is only slightly higher than an expended so around _ of course maybe that plan works but i will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before that was three years before all medium versions of delta future missions have all delta fixed costs piled so their cost is now for missions contracted for launch after nutty both exhaust velocity and mass ratio drive the rocket also matters a lot for delta upper stage is but mass ratio and thrust are the performance numbers in this database are not in process of being even if they a fully expendable falcon which far exceeds the performance of a delta iv is compared to over for delta iv love and rockets if i can just figure out how to attach those to a really big shark falcon heavy engine plumes look like giant laser beams in this photo by last pic of in roadster on its journey to mars orbit and then the asteroid belt third burn exceeded mars

almost will be set to life on customs problem or maybe enhancement some customs agencies are saying they won‚Äôt allow shipment of anything called a to solve we are renaming it a early access build and especially build are but the features aren‚Äôt reliable enough yet release candidate in final testing phase no i think we‚Äôve figured it out yes small but each one will come with a serial number from 1 to a would be really fun all flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher flamethrowers sold out of course yes this rocket was meant to test very high landing in water so it didn‚Äôt hurt the but amazingly it has we will try to tow it back to is a fuzzy bear üêª from the world‚Äôs leading experts in zombie defense now that‚Äôs a real flamethrower falcon heavy in foreground on launch complex and falcon 9 in background on so hard to keep future product releases secret for and it keeps you warm at the same time coming soon sure sentience is overrated but there‚Äôs the flamethrower is its safe word is and it comes with a free hmm portal now that would be you‚Äôd need millions of zombies for a where would i even get a factory big enough to make so the rumor that secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false good thing you didn‚Äôt ask about the unless you like fun a flamethrower is a super terrible definitely don‚Äôt buy ordered only when the zombie apocalypse you‚Äôll be glad you bought a works against hordes of the or your money don‚Äôt do this says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than ft is our design is max fun for least be way more scared of a steak great for roasting nuts üî• ü•ú the boring company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any say hello to my little friend aiming for first flight of falcon heavy on 6 from launchpad at cape easy viewing from the public falcon heavy firing this morning was generated quite a thunderhead of launching in a week or check for updates done you will be able to do pretty much anything via voice software team is focused on core model 3 functionality right but that will be done then we will add a lot more there aren‚Äôt even good normal parties in silicon you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in there are other items you can upgrade too but i recommend keeping those parts that sounds will fixed in next release long exposure of rocket reentry from space and landing ) good we can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into of and an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie near gonna put an old school roller skates rock restaurant at one of the new supercharger locations in la falcon heavy goes vertical using a neural net to detect rain using cameras dedicated rain or sun computers are very come work at the biggest most advanced factory on located by a river near the beautiful sierra mountains with wild horses roaming coming very soon vastly better coming soon sure it‚Äôs had to upgrade old and a bunch of drivers major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few will be slower at first until code is similar total maybe slightly bigger to account for a really feature like to sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage that will be a big focus next with primary remaining model 3 was gonna say we‚Äôll do all but the but that last one sounds like cheesy fun should be in next update done i promise that we will make a pickup truck right after model have had the core elements in my mind for almost 5 am dying to build sorry for the we have the most advanced neural net of any consumer product by so it‚Äôs going through exhaustive the results are blowing me away though and i think you will have a similar wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to owners for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would so much sweat tears from the team went into creating cars that you‚Äôd truly i hope you how can we improve we at whatever is left over after we build the the circle is complete hats sold flamethrowers it does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail true so strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the given a set of possible why pick the extremely unlikely yes having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens when you get the new software go ho ho there‚Äôs an egg inside the but it‚Äôs not limited edition boring hats to then i think last night might have been the biggest test ever isn‚Äôt it if you liked tonight‚Äôs you will really like falcon heavy next 3 rocket cores 2 cores return to base doing synchronized lands on never heard of it nuclear alien from north it was definitely aliens launch underway his is in literature presumably bad fiction how much is i love twitter bloody going to have to write a can‚Äôt fit this into i would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart public transit is obviously not fully solving the as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in tunnels can solve but we need much better tunneling as it is currently super slow and major navigation overhaul coming in early will be ahead of current but we are testing it rigorously before rolling for the i actually love most subways and idiots can be very dangerous when they seem but aren‚Äôt in their bio is a dead as some policymakers may get that‚Äôs what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit glad to see that owners are having a good working to improve some cool software updates coming sorry about thanks for letting me will get it pics soon with people so you can see scale if things go all three rocket booster cores will come back and sides back at the center on the falcon heavy launching from same pad as the v moon it was higher thrust with five engines at i love that rocket so max thrust at is million pounds or metric first mission will run at hate it when that some people are so falcon heavy at the cape knight rider is real for we only use those on super hot reentry will go to all ti with falcon 9 which is a few months where‚Äôs the i also support the concave earth and hollow globe just covering my bases meant to say good it‚Äôs just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesn‚Äôt actually represent my point of view at other publications referred to it as an sorry you‚Äôre an idiot this depressingly misleading misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an not from an interview with wired as is falsely this is why i stopped following wired long there are way better tech pubs out yes pretty much anywhere yes hat in appreciation for their exquisite taste in will be picked at random to tour the la tunnel drive boring machine our existence cannot just be about solving one miserable problem after there need to be reasons to it is high time that humanity went beyond should have a moon base by now and sent astronauts to the future needs to and those are just the really big the was especially unless you were a safest flamethrower ever i know it‚Äôs a little but kids love it after we will start selling the boring company flamethrower over hats plus a towel and a sign saying on will attempt to both an orbital rocket and spacecraft for the yes do it the money comes from i learned it from this documentary deal that special hat delivery will take place deep within the but fictional tunnel we are building under la while you drive the giant machine this will actually beyond anything you can imagine at the risk of stating the extremely boring because it‚Äôs stupid maybe every buyer of our boringly boring hat will get a free hat signed by the delivery guy hat yes busted to preserve the transcendent majesty of the boring company we are capping cap orders at almost there that‚Äôs certainly the right way to go to store massive amounts of data for a long time foundation books should def be part of the they‚Äôre i love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future red car for a red planet yeah yes payload will be my midnight cherry roadster playing space destination is mars will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn‚Äôt blow up on falcon heavy to launch next month from pad at the will have double thrust of next largest guaranteed to be one way or what does it look racing video part 2 model x races a gasoline sports car while towing a sports car electric pods for rails maybe a loop is like a but without drawing a vacuum inside the don‚Äôt need to get rid of air friction for short kinda the boring company will compete to build operate a loop connecting airport to downtown why is there no flat mars _ as said i am definitely a martian int not a friend sent me part of a a few but i don‚Äôt know where it mars sky is the opposite of earth blue sunrise and sunset red during the day they played in it‚Äôs just unfold the visor and lift the otherwise you‚Äôd only see a blur got to regulate like we do aircraft public risks require public getting rid of the make flying they‚Äôre there for good this is in a few that bot will move so fast you‚Äôll need a strobe light to see sweet thanksgiving in the love my bro . courtesy of his adjusting soon congratulations to the crew and south authorities who worked so hard to get this manufactured and installed in record initial hat offering going great w over in hat sales thanks for buying our super boring you figuratively all cash goes directly towards more good point for one aliens built the who but aliens could have figured out how to align and stack stone blocks in a series of concentric i guess maybe not saying the next gen roadster special upgrade package definitely enable it to fly short but maybe certainly just a question of rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary should clarify that this is the base model there will be a special option package that takes it to the next semi 0 to in sec date is tomorrow night at this pic is from the old it can transform into a fight aliens and make one hell of a latte do you really believe that someone‚Äôs life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely that is a to illustrate meaning that obviously a single careless statement should ruins someone‚Äôs life say scientists ‚Äî among other insights gained ‚Äî after a large vat of overturned in the also humans are just sentient drywall tastes like a marshmallow and gravity is the last point remains heavily semi truck unveil to be webcast live on at this will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate just need to find my portal gun sunset at the sure one my words are against choose i placed the flowers three broken ribs a pierced lung and still he fought for peace one slightly toasted ft so should be 2 miles long in three or four months and hopefully stretch the whole corridor from lax to the in a year or picture of the boring company la tunnel taken yesterday just want to express a word of appreciation for the hard work of the reason i camped on the roof was because it was less time than driving to a hotel room in production circle and or not campfire on the roof just feed it the godfather movies as what‚Äôs the worst that could it‚Äôs true tho groan on the list of people who should absolutely be allowed to develop digital don't exactly need to be it won't even need to ask you most of the time a reminder of the youth of our year be we are not even a flash in the pan compared to the year age of i won't even bother mentioning the age of the not ready to do a proper announcement but maybe in a month or has been awesome to work with and just wanted to say but the hat is congratulations to of buyer of hat you have won a free hat signed by the boring now at hats there is an actual tunnel and it's getting longer every day it all comes full circle second boring machine almost will be called after the poem by be my love in the and credit for the logo art to almost hats sold so whoever buys the gets a free hat with their credit for the boring company name goes to gonna build that tunnel one hat at a time the world's most boring hat amazing sim of neutron stars colliding that was a i didn't realize people actually used yesterday's ask me anything about you're welcome on in 2 hours and other places that's just to win our student competition in mile practical version would have a turbo compressor on front taking ram air pressure at near sonic to speeds driving that thru air rearward for party to be more how about a your tech could make the sound like horses steam gasoline aim for kn of thrust on a kg game stamping model 3 body panels i own two gasoline one is a model t that a friend gave me and the other is a series 1 my first but i do have a wing this weekend just posted a photo very high pressure air cold gas the last of ten iridium global communication satellites delivered to orbit several hundred everything all at once _ that is actual it is slowed down right now to confirm build consistency and so that a person can stop the robots in time if something goes the model 3 body line slowed down to speed is big don't underestimate the power of just kept working on my crown and don't let anyone tell you magic isn't extremely powerful this doesn't even innocent you forgot to add the video version of their response assume the now i need to get back to doesn't there is only one being built right so the only question is don't need a for bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential late is but not literally every day makes a big will be a big so but it is impossible to be certain right now yeah doing my best to but that is a fair if i wasn't inherently i wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first med medical equipment has priority probably 6 to 8 weeks you'll know as soon as we we are deep in production hell üî• or do high pain tolerance semi specs are better than anything seen reported so semi team work is but other needs are greater right semi unveil now diverting resources to fix model 3 bottlenecks increase battery production for other affected not sounds like some party installers are taking advantage of demand taking action the internal install team in pr is very small right sending experienced installers from continental us to hire train local team as fast as always charges the same price for a taxes shipping costs so something is messed up asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive sounds i look forward to talking later today i would be happy to can be hell with that we will party like and wish they could've we should definitely get a room i know that closet is nice and but it's time you admitted you are one of the creators of the next everyone already knows and we will still love you just as much auditioning to be a roofing in the greater area the singularity for this level of the simulation is coming i wonder what the levels above us look good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are so even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality the team has done this for many smaller islands around the but there is no so it can be done for such a decision would be in the hands of the pr any commercial stakeholders most the people of final episode was disgustingly good i believe i can fly aiming for two rocket landings in hours this weekend it would need to refill to but it could get to with low payload homes on with a going right now for great assuming max acceleration of 2 to 3 but in a comfortable will feel like a mild to moderate amusement park ride on ascent and then peaceful silent in zero gravity for most of the trip until yup part 2 fly to most places on earth in under and anywhere in under cost per seat should will take you anywhere on earth in less than mars city opposite of dawn and dusk sky are blue on mars and day sky is moon base alpha will be announcing something really special at today's talk just another day in the office congrats i love ideas for paying cost collecting which turned out to be less lucrative than expected headed to soon to describe new planetary colonizer design in detail . this should be worth design feels i did good article from several years ago about the value of fiction yes simulation of how the interplanetary spaceship and rocket design would will good major improvements some unexpected applications to be unveiled on at in presentation of interplanetary spaceship rocket design from that's not a lot of money for a giant like wish they'd do off by a don't give up if the cause is important even if you believe you are walking into good friends really we expect to expand the facility significantly over does my count as def not just sent a reminder to stores that we just want people to look forward to their next that's what really in discussions with national just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in what if we just made a mini version of the of course high res version at most of it long road to of falcon 9 primary boost upper stage fairing also costs will drop by a factor actually yes semi truck unveil test ride tentatively scheduled for in worth seeing this beast in it's promise to be as boring as yes exactly astronaut spacesuit next to crew dragon exciting tweets coming sorry about you're i was depressing myself too don't need to follow normal they will obtain developed by companies at if should be low on our list of concerns for existential has no entangling alliances that polarize world into launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their as us and china invade and end the regime immediately may be initiated not by the country but one of the if it decides that a strike is most probable path to victory soon all countries w strong computer competition for superiority at national level most likely cause of zeroth law it begins putting together rocket landing blooper we messed up a lot before it finally but there's some epic explosion footage not a bad for it makes sense to test for safety in some kind of open world / sandbox virtual in about six months or linked to dual motor we took the pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what tunnels are sealed to 5 atmospheres of water gas just need walls around the not but probably feature coming soon they're so anyone going to that much trouble must really gladly follow their but they're so obtuse that's pretty much why we did it worth reading life by . will be the best or worst thing ever for so let‚Äôs get it vacuum tube runs parallel to on jack it is miles long and just under 6 ft in to be a passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect for nor uncomfortable acceleration brakes will run the pusher sled later this week and see what it can do moon base alpha but i loved plus mars not that this is remotely equiv to man on the but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it his architecture was thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same pod run by team the could def find us but maybe it won't care a model s in the boring company tunnel being dug under in it is a tiny one high only needed because tube is for passenger this can be spread over so no no such thing as true so actually yes call it might be possible to go supersonic in our test even though it's only miles very high needed congratulations to team from tech univ for winning peak speed of which is over just arrived at the competition student teams have amazing i hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of and as the probability of failure was coming next along with completing the highway and interconnecting and central funny thing whenever i suggest all companies go to zero room gets very that's because others get a lot more than literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my others put them in happy to go to zero incentives for not an just believe in putting money into my own don't think the approach is the there are pretty long gaps between each team so is not the way to from last but still my favorite video of the falcon 9 rocket booster returning from and the boring company are running the competition does not really have that's a will be hanging with my little on let me check on that for found the answer right it was misinterpreted by at as a fundraising is not seeking has been laboriously negative for over a surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by is not raising money max recovered booster velocity was mach energy is velocity so this is a bigger difference than it appears max mach max km highest so but velocity matters much more probably or so yes it is approximately the size of a carrot vertical velocity lateral velocity tilt ‚Äã lateral from target center falcon 9 boost stage on just read the instructions a midnight followed by a vigorously opposed someone has been naughty i played those games that's a engineer in not me new model x now faster than a it's kinda but my boys and i love it first picture of more in days to worth noting that this actually i would say that is the greatest publication in the history of all conscious living or dead not the of ball mason not judging was at a friend's party this weekend and drank wine from a mason jar i can't hide the truth any more yes watching eclipse with sunglasses on through the model s glass rocket factory as seen from space but not a priority right now not coming for just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of we are going to move all info and settings to the so any you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you pics of spacesuit developed for commercial crew program coming out next undergoing ocean landing totally this was a foolish at some features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to that's been on the future feature list for a need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain will prob do something like that problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc will we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the it should probably automatically adjust to the user of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched good we will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software i love but you can check it out on . this isn't a like cliff diving or fake rocket that matters if it's wigs me out too deleting just that the permitting process is slow i want one can support houses of any but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a model the danger is def high for south due to but much less for distant targets like the tech is we certainly while not suggesting confident that the us and intelligence have this covered mission of our dragon robotic space freighter in support of the first draft animation of the falcon heavy three core is twice the thrust of the for sure biggest impediment to recognizing danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't would like to express our appreciation to for use of their azure cloud computing this required massive processing + 2 it is far too complex for requires a team of the world's best researchers with massive computing nobody likes being but everything that's a danger to the public is should be i sure hope but we can't take that for granted if you're not concerned about you should vastly more risk than north first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess coming soon hi a level 9 orc illusionist and dressmaker this is about as true as time being a paragon of great please spend at least 8 seconds checking your just because i have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a that requires years of there are dozens of bogus or anecdotes don't really matter maybe 5 to that guess i could post for those one other like to correct from the i never said i was a said i was that's a didn't say that was given weeks of salary stock in appreciation for her great contribution left to join a small once again as a generalist was an amazing assistant for over but as company complexity the role required several specialists vs one generalist of all the bogus this one troubles me the never actually ran this story by me or my it is total biography is mostly but also rife with errors never independently despite my request that he do so major increases in the supercharger and urban charger network happening over the next several months first draft animation of the falcon heavy three core is twice the thrust of the i working on it it's only a matter of time y although the is least likely to be clicked on by people who really should change their view of by complaints are you complaining that we are not complaining and let's not forget the forum on which we are heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on like i said it gets really dark there are frequent complaint expansion packs except for that has remained constant throughout history at officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed on a single congratulations owners i guess a proof of concept is needed looking forward to launching astronauts to the international space station next sorry about you certainly should have will get you guys in a car right must brake safely to a halt student top speed competition coming up we poured our heart into the hope you love sure hope so thoughtful model 3 review by , one of the most insightful journalists there are several dozen ship names in the culture but i liked those best it's better than a model we can put a lot more in a car at a higher sure there are better answers than what i which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing if you buy a ticket to it isn't fair to blame hell maybe not medically bad feelings correlate to bad so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what i sign up yeah the reality is great terrible lows and unrelenting don't think people want to hear about the last model 3 uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control model 3 interior yes probably middle of next focus now is on getting out of model 3 production more versions = deeper in yes sure watched them personally to make sure i agree with the wouldn't have judged amazing videos but was couldn't believe how incredibly inspiring and creative they second third project winners setting up for model 3 handover tomorrow night if we're lucky sides run high center is lower thrust until sides separate fly center then throttles keeps burning lands on side booster rockets return to cape center lands on falcon heavy maiden launch this team will verify testing the boring company car elevator love this drag racing video movie on the subject coming piece on is but we actually face a double exponential rate of hardware software are both talked to mark about his understanding of the subject is a book of the most beautiful classic cars given to me on my birthday on a farm in van starry price in plus import duties and sales tax we can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public will check if possible through a feeder fund often comes as a surprise when people learn that of my time is on and just on other stuff a diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories i postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket spaceship design in will be on the final discussing physics of tunnels with mayor has a physics support for the boring company much kinda have to would be logistics costs for and are verbal approval was at federal still a lot of work before written but this opens door for state city adding and providence would be the natural extension of the line an underground would mean no disruption above ground and be way so i think it is he right way to go city of already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from to they've been if you want this to happen please let your local federal elected representatives makes a big difference if they hear from still a lot of work needed to receive formal but am optimistic that will occur rapidly for first set of tunnels are to alleviate greater la urban will start in then prob and a support would be much city center to city center in each with up to a dozen or more elevators in each city just received verbal govt approval for the boring company to build an underground in plan is to do powered landings on mars for but with a vastly bigger ship y need to explain full story of so much nonsense out amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels confused not attacking just making sure people don't have the wrong not email from i should stock is obviously high based on past but low if you believe in place bets accordingly otherwise hard to find them y it is so fine by me small thing but i made it this way for those who care and source and appearance are the it's what you don't say i do have one what does good point now it's yes stay tuned i told you it was better tomorrow excited to announce the launch of it's a little verbose right but that will be fixed just checked and yes primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than falcon falcon heavy is needed commercially procured launches means launches that were openly is not allowed to compete for many us and us senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space we do that but for free hopefully other also develop reusable orbital if an airplane co had reusable buying single use airplanes seem that doesn't sound right worth noting that on get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch does latest s and x tires have internal acoustic foam going over the small nuances of model 3 very important that nothing sounds the very near the far away future you can now drive anywhere in the us n most of china japan using the supercharger of on university above the old bakery one of my sons is named after professor that's probably the best use cool üòé maybe the upcoming in it was a tough but they seemed like good i hope they kept the would be worth a lot that pizza looked about as appetizing as if they were doing people at the party a favor by taking wasn't wearing a am def not part of a didn't even know were just went to say hi to my friend ken thanks for allowing me to buy back no plans right but it has great sentimental value to first production model 3 it's who is first to pay full price for the hard i have first roadster and but not first had rights to car as he was to place a full but gave those rights to me as my production unit 1 of model 3 is now built and going through final pics never heard of them stop biting my finger dammit this will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of the world's population is accelerating towards but few seem to notice or care thanks ! really proud of the rocket and team min apogee requirement was falcon 9 achieved team reviewed all systems again late last done our best to ensure all is we're going to spend the doing a full review of rocket pad launch no earlier than only one chance to get it right wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a it matters to us that you took a risk on a new car we won't looks like we can reach model 3 cars per month in handover party for first customer model on the production grows so should be cars and above model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of expecting to complete on is awesome china manufacturing quality is among other that's where many android phones most laptops are another launch today if weather is good coming later today sorry to hear about china launch failure i know how painful that is to the people who designed built suggestions i think said that or does the earth move this is a really great floor just installed steel skeleton of the should be operating next across the road and below the ground perspective nothing to be but it's all right news on because it's off the wall maybe it is time for the man cape to return didn't read might now exactly me too but arguably that's worse and i don't care who knows our love will never just try it's way better than you a floor that moves a ceiling is simply a floor from below not as much as tunnels though they are so underappreciated they will never let you down i love floors is a speed long way to go before we beat but i am no longer waiting for it has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in good summary of rocket landing there were two successful water landings much but they didn't survive several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack peak heating is the cube of so a mach 8 reentry is mach they should on high velocity missions to geostationary transfer orbit sped up version of today's rocket landing on the just read the instructions more effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections down the they will not even be repainted between aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in getting closer to fairing recovery and had some problems with the steerable should have it sorted out by end of new titanium grid fins worked even better than should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no still humans significantly improves control force launch at delivering satellites for due to extreme will be closeup of the titanium grid not as they glow red hot during a fast we used to have a open loop hydraulic but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago not only it has all the and is coming soon rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before heavy gust or something malfunctioned reviewing but that's a minor factor for rockets but shielding got every more control authority is for falcon but also enables falcon 9 to land in heavier they but the hydraulic system is closed so no fluid they do need more power but rocket has plenty of slightly heavier than shielded but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups flying with larger significantly upgraded grid single piece cast cut can take reentry heat with no sticking to it's an aluminum honeycomb so only a couple of hours to replace rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard almost all of the emergency crush but otherwise good falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's good chance rocket booster doesn't make it looks i forgot bacon in there are no easy choices do want irony on social must remember that irony and social media are not keep radiation groan but with electric is really good in snow all weather or winter as traction control is far more precise will extend over km should be possible in a with the right tires will be full cooled all the way out to the 3 meter nozzle heat flux is nuts view factor is no plans to change pack you'll never worry about running out of model 3 pack is about cost not no need to rely on scientists for global warming just use a thermometer cool that's because the accurate articles are boringly so they get no press attention first approximation of is production factoring in energy so model 3 less to produce than gas car by a lot calling this would be much less energy required for batteries is powered by no plans to change cell form factor for x and s this is but max smart mentions chaos towards the there's a my real phone is an which i ordered after seeing this ad nothing beats the shoe phone that is also a real shoe but then i get paid less backup valve shows no sign of but yeah if schedule holds there will be two falcon 9 launches within hours this weekend postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic it is dual but not worth taking a promising conversations with regarding tunnel network that would carry bikes permits harder than it's time they knew service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper so soon you won't believe it colonizing mars prof for creating this from my major changes to the plan coming flying through the falcon factory mars plan coming which i think addresses the most fundamental flaw in how to pay for development operation of giant rockets braking on is getting better with every we're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a in the fog cost diff between and exceeds avg value of so flying with means satellite is basically free in discussions with the government of requesting temporary relief on import until a local factory is built us govt testing by finds model x to be the safest in history by significant margin that would an interesting of only count if capable of doing so right off the production line with street legal how'd you kernel update was way harder than giant but meant way more overhead tuning to keep screen frame rate good new kernel goes out next new web browser next braking is getting steadily better for both 1 and autopilot release should go wide next weekend with additional smoothness improvements to longitudinal control we are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the mars regardless of nationality everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable thanks for supporting and the mission before anyone had heard of us heard about our experience doing projects with big car companies was not they move slowly are reluctant to adopt new written two master but haven't told the history of how we got lot of drama prob worth mostly the feasibility study martin commissioned about the lotus was dead wrong only of parts ended up being slow at then very def not the the gravity damn was no just a biz plan to commercialize no tech or no employees didn't even own motors disruption deep is the real not exactly congrats so crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed you may have heard of the person who put it together worth watching killed the electric by . truth is indeed stranger than fiction if is kind enough to send me a it's on _ all superchargers are being converted to over almost all will disconnect from the electricity i love which is the world leader in great example for the rest of the long way to but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start programs gave them all our patents to so that's something nothing to do w govt incentives or making thought prob of losing it all did many but it was the only since big car companies were killing their the only chance was to create an even tho it was almost certain to fail they was done against the will of their who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars few people know that we started when gm forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in then crushed them in a junkyard that is ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on nothing else will get you click the left scroll wheel to pause or mute music good will add to voice commands too awesome must half not bee first of i cracked a long time that's not i can see how did you car should auto play when it gets an exact like it does for will make that just confirmed the station works in cool it's yes tap cancel on the screen just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say or or voice commands work pretty just depends on whether you like a sedan or sedan goes has more coming back coming partly possibly my favorite skit might work in too i mean also not yet yeah in the you can ask your to play any python other doesn't work outside us it's on the might add it to the app at some so you get it on your phone if you have a or my favorite for sure try the new station on streaming radio the scene where is saved from the by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best ex moment of any movie ever all falcon heavy cores should be at the cape in two to three so launch should happen a month after that love python so much just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of that yeah yeah these guys want us to die so bad they can taste it could be worse we can either give up hope sit in traffic hell forever or try something the odds of success may be but they're better than the boring company is in and has already approved the permit thanks such an outrageous people sometimes underestimate strength of us lot of respect for the judge jury read falcon heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at once you add the vintage record it's all good you're a little red vintage some and a 7 step facial treatment every the mistake people make is stopping at and um not trying to brag or but i think i look good for seems that way of what system were you that's why the pic is in black and didn't have color back i counted shareholder meeting can't believe it's been years since we went this is a metaphor for obviously sec etc not they're but or is it more about the way you use i hope wrong probably closer to to would be a linear but progress is great they should write for . most likely we will have a very high headcount around each keeping it they just won't be doing repetitive probably closer to four or five logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end wearing anything at all is just a conspiracy by the capitalist running dogs of big underwear he was great though was just at the dude had the actual sloth from on his desk most people don't realize you can see dragon approach the space station from the even in la proud of my mom pretty much dead we painted the target area with radio reflective which helps the radar be more exactly it's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse that's how it is for cars airplanes and how it should be for first of a dragon spacecraft set for later today good point commits to sell only electric cars by it is already the largest market for solar under china committed to produce as much clean electricity by as the us does from all sources today am departing presidential climate change is leaving is not good for or the coming soon yeah will have no choice but to depart councils in that case don't know which way will but done all i can to advise directly to through others in via that we remain and then some it was piggyback rides around the opera house is such a beautiful city a lot i do via my which is now years but my grants are anonymous yes should finish this a stop in swift current for yes comparing model s vs model 3 fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks there will be a combined booster static maybe a that cloud is almost entirely including dark parts a this is what the launch looks falcon heavy is this times one way or launch is guaranteed to be exciting will shut that the point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to 5 only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain you are going at max not much time busted will keep the original bond lotus sub that design can't actually convert from car to have a new design in mind that true feel exactly the same way as particularly loved the spy who loved me all model s and x cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few i spoke directly with the president three weeks ago about many others have cautiously optimistic of a positive interesting would give a dynamic deg surround view as you're have this in can be a bit distracting early next to start we're making the simplest model 3 like we did with didn't do it with because i was an we could add that function pretty easily from a technical just need to add in the billing can be set higher than that for but limited to or off highway avg drive for pedestrian cyclist safety exactly still on for end of just software any car with cars built since last will be able to do there's just no hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be would cost more to retrofit than trading doesn't have enough sensors and computing hopefully for those too s for it is a bigger highly recommend upgrading to latest model s is approx version only if you really want a smaller should you get a maybe but i was told that of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in to support control algorithm is but new one is even but super almost plus much improved web browser that will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in almost probably in a few you can easily turn it off in the car via but that would beg the question of why you turned it off something cool for sure excited about the autopilot software release rolling out next new control algorithm feels as smooth as model model x model s will all have same level of autopilot it's just a matter of refining the vision control wear underpants will do black and textured slate versions will be yes for reason i can't i find especially not a fan of . has led too many people astray in valuing still agree with what are is an but there's still a core that holds true over uncertainty principle practical limits of simultaneity in transfer make this exact thought experiment but yeah we got stuck all the answers to questions you never asked about holes in the ground what what i love about the boring company are the low nowhere to go but in a model x at mph moonlight sonata robots that learn by example from _ it's sort of like a if you use the claw but has the added advantage of also hammering the snail is like speedy on meth or one of the either our tunnel is still a distant and it's done worked in just of why is that even a gonna dig that tunnel with this here hammer my grandmother was from moose jaw going to a barn on my cousin's farm in at wearing a hat on a hat worked on the farm when i was family history was born in south but named after my yes this may cause motion sickness or this is a test run of our electric the race between our pet snail who lives in a and our tunnel boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter going through final in operation at standard industry planning to jack this up by a factor of first tunnel for the boring company begins full length of first tunnel will run from lax entry staging area and starting tunnel for boring machine 1 now complete _ needs to iterate fast on solar roof so all installs will be done by techs at first third one will be from maybe the first machine is still waiting don't know when or naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems decided against plays too that's how the tiles sit on the there is no difference in strength for the tile based on orientation like this is the economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are hail cannonball impacting solar roof tile will do our yes solar roof can be ordered for almost any deployment this year in the us and overseas next black glass smooth and textured will be and french slate in about six delivery and installation next year yes solar glass roof orders open this i think it will be more in about hours if heat death of the universe is the it really is all about the journey it's a good one thanks for doing headed to see guardians 2 w my bro and loved the first i do love but perhaps we should reserve his names for the i like kinda like snoop dug i don't want to be presumptuous i know what you're thinking then why not learned my lesson about by calling it it has more credibility maybe ultimate boring the second boring not boring good one been done thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine was just rereading one of my so beautiful of rocket stage fast burn in a ring of fire and landing launch and landing of the spy satellite was tough as high altitude wind shear was at of the theoretical load winds aloft are unusually high within structural safety but not a will probably publish an update in six weeks or so my boring ted talk couldn't agree more extremely even more boring boring we def want to avoid particularly surface detail on it now great great and with great we all really enjoyed the will definitely do that on my next trip having moo moo at moo moo gold coast with and that is the to avoid becoming sorry i missed this would only work for packs that are software created to so not yes will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a to a pickup truck unveil in to months next gen roadster will be convertible semi truck unveil set for team has done an amazing seriously next yeah i already said we'd add more independent members during will announce but this group has nothing to do with this investor group should buy ford their governance is amazing survey finds used car values are highest and sell fastest fairing is but that should be reusable this am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to latency should only be 5 min checking feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered eggs and so the robots spared humanity is absurdly overvalued if based on the but that's a stock price represents future cash stormy weather in coal is dying due to gas it's basically it's just a helicopter in helicopter's clothing it won't matter pretty good why did we waste so much time developing silly damn so you have all this crazy but can't speak technology turns out are actually a message from aliens describing the secret of teleportation def with although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that we can def bring it back like just a question of how much weight we need to working on it looks like it could do more with some structural upgrades to handle higher but that's in fully expendable a lot silliest thing we can secret payload of dragon flight was a giant wheel of inspired by a friend good odds go from to falcon heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer considering trying to bring upper stage back on falcon heavy demo flight for full odds of success but maybe worth a browser is already a little kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so of underlying with a few nice thanks incredibly proud of the team for achieving this milestone in next goal is within if you just downloaded tap the the t on center screen three times on center center screen show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to very we have yet to do a china launch of model glad to have as an investor and advisor to no you won't care what gave me no here is the latest travel ad for the flight around the moon into deep maybe needs a few edits long piece coming out on in about a difficult to dedicate the but existential risk is too high not we cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a you would get first in yes yes i believe so yup oh so little faith the shorter wheelbase only allows for a pack in model 3 at current energy densities yeah start taking orders in probably a year from s will still win on acceleration due to having more space for a larger only model s will have the seven more cargo plus higher two screens vs auto extend handles the model s produced today is arguably version let me put it this it is the car i will keep driving even after model 3 if fate is on our it will be will talk about that in detail next no problem should be summer next really wish we could get done we truly are working as fast as we let me just go fetch my magic wand first in line for dual motor as soon as we can make which is probably in 6 to 9 damn straight we coming with next first drive of a release candidate version of model 3 it still has one display nothing majorly new that a consumer would lots of new tech in the design and production process the more autonomous a car the less dash info you how often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a how about the video we just took of the first model 3 release candidate machine arrives next month and we start digging the i think so we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on only for early just like model because i was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion next week model s will always be the fastest until next gen which is a few years but not until next year hardware already on all production s and x model 3 is like a 3 series or model s is like 5 and 6 but much more storage space + autopilot how about oh model y is coming too in a few kinda have all cars built since last year will be capable of as software improves definitely model 3 was going to be called model for obvious dumb humor but ford sued to block so now it is totally different yes model 3 is just a more affordable version of model s w less range power fewer model s has more advanced am noticing that many people think model 3 is the of a like 2 vs this is not looking forward to playing the game with my i used to be you're trying my at hope it's a bit just because building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean an alien the number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live by at least a thousand to being either great filter or they are very i hope that didn't work where are the looks like for release except that isn't actually my house perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for but this is not i am this bill changes almost nothing about what is existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for 3 is a great but definitely model s good point i it's so an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense it's been a bear to get but prob days or depending on full speed test results looking forward to i know it's but is my favorite book ever want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater just check out my prior tweet on pricing at pack website will be updated so there is complete . can only happen with your and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many who came out in support of the battery especially i love just gets better over answer is complex for electric we use an ac induction motor fed by a dc pack thru an which kinda dc power high voltage dc is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long good explanation at direct current is the right approach even though alternating was right in the solar power electronics both you're most very exciting to discuss the future of + storage arguably biggest disruption since dc to just spoke with , premier of south very govt is clearly committed to a quick but and installation labor vary by as those costs are beyond our control at the pack level for is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all will get the system installed and working days from contract signature or it is that serious enough for will send you one thanks thank you for the lovely that sounds like a great we'll do could not do this without can't express enough this is not works for a lot of people and that's but maybe done it 7 or 8 times fly me to the moon announcement tomorrow at of course maybe one of those too roller coasters are awesome something on a border might plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large good chance it will exactly i didn't pose for it that's or want me on tunnel boring machine pic be way better minor improvements update this high speed in about two excellent model x review just posted a video baby came back no system was green for i called it they are often in this we have already retired so much risk on dragon that i feel very confident of uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side so no dedicated pump or fluid needed likely to be fine loop overcome but that chance isn't worth rolling the better to wait a not obviously related to the helium but also not out of the question if this is the only flight would be but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause all systems except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly standing down to counting down to the first launch from the launch pad tomorrow morning photo provided dragon 2 demo missions go is highly confident of being able to fly us astronauts in looks like we are go for added an abort trigger at secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start investigating a leak in the upper if will launch but only deep in solid where the walls are and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed it's much easier to do the that way daylight rocket launch landing at the cape this will be the flight from the launch i used that one what are some good will have to meter these kids can't die from groaning too they are doing proud you may come to regret that request so that makes it awesome achievement by very there is this thing called and i make them you're i can't hide any i am irony they were earlier drafts that i accidentally i said the same thing a week in is providing all repair costs free of charge and congrats to the owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a best place to watch is on the cape causeway sounds like the and might be useful falcon 9 rocket now vertical at cape on launch complex this is the same what this person said is please check your and joined as soon as we received the which was of course it will should all be uploaded by next month motor trend could only achieve sec when they tested the i don't know what make you think that's a it's completely covered in a and baker article in regarding a carbon tax yes hoping for summer this year altitude improves performance for opposite of combustion will be wheelbase can't fit service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further no plans to take s above semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go take out the floor mats and its mt said everything had to be standard yes production model s sets motor trend world record to mph in sec signing off that was more than enough twitter trouble for one _ no rare earth metals in battery almost ready app update is about two weeks kernel and browser update probably a month or autopilot has but model 3 is the overwhelming priority i will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through and in his one of my favorite almost we are just being very careful with the a lot of terrible things could happen in four years of do you really want another that's where extremism it is hard to convey complex ideas in chars and tone is lost in text people should push to have as many moderates advising the president as blind hate is never the right rolling out a new update we should try our best i will work harder on thinking first and tweeting sorry for anything i just had three coffees mars is critical for the survival of humanity and life on earth as we know it numeric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction i love half my mom was born in my grandfather was born in me i hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon i great looking forward to taking my kids for a heard it is incredibly me being one of them not perfect be but out of countries with only a diff to place means it's essentially on par fair sorry activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise not how could having only extremists advise him possibly be exactly is great on all love and twitter is a hater good not for trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive i think it's kinda cool isn't that basically like having a jury of that is a default option in the those countries have strong justice but put them roughly on par with that rating system conflates many did you read my i attacked it did not you're politics is a somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that also there are several that are on par with just don't think any are people confuse laws with mostly laws exactly the laws need to judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the not making the remedy for that is changing the law but what's up the there are many good legal systems on par with just don't know any that are many in don't realize how proud they should be of the legal not but nowhere is the cause of justice better walking down the street and saw this i then so be rather do what i believe is than do what appears right simply to avoid that's exactly what i love nuances are important ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under really don't want to get in i just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve feels so for but this should be addressed on all legislative and in i again raised i believe this is doing so will remain on council keep at doing otherwise would be at my the agenda for yesterday's white house meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost first heard of this will find out maybe video of entrant into the air has been removed from the tube to almost vacuum green cards dual citizens already work spousal visas not but hopefully this is separate from judicial there has already been and there will be progress on this matter regarding the meeting at the white yes headline article is i said it won't be retracted withdrawn by it may be revoked by judicial or legislative i believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity top researchers agree on principles for developing i agree with creating great restoring us strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting sorry about that the order is still but it is always important to read the source material reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material strategic policy forum there is no possibility of but there is possibility of it's just a don't know please read immigration specific will seek advisory council consensus present to it is not many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the they've done wrong don't deserve to be the blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily countries is not the best way to address the country‚Äôs challenges this is if adding lanes actually did make it that would imply removing lanes makes it not and we start digging the tunnel tonight pod race happening this weekend at we built a long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit am hearing this from a lot of people it's getting me just trying to make a positive contribution hope good comes of earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the like waves on that's why la can have a but getting starting across from my desk at and the which is 5 from lax yup maybe next month exciting progress on the tunnel plan to start digging in a month or supports a carbon this is what is really needed to move the just saying that we should see what happens the actions may be no they don't was wondering what those were sigh that may be a difficult award to decline also said that risk of climate change does and he believed should be on how to address threats of climate they do require a global at his confirmation think it‚Äôs important that the united states maintain its seat at the table in the conversation soldier my dark secret is out i share the economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise is an exceptionally competent understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his his team is now the this may sound surprising coming from but i agree with the has the potential to be an excellent sec of there will be a software update this weekend that improves ability 3 months 6 months definitely safety should improve significantly due to autonomy even if disallow no driver present auto steer limited to mph on highways for heavy where it is needed limit will raise as we get more autonomy capability should improve via every 2 to 6 weeks for now the price takes into account exchange rate whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted block 5 is the final upgrade of the falcon significantly improves performance ease of flies end of if we applied resources to doing super complex our pace of innovation would drop dramatically will never stop people are buying the wrong car if they expect there will be major revs every to yes that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing wish there was an easy giant x made of model by owners in future flights will go on falcon heavy or the upgraded falcon car won't complete camera working on software solution to adjust image crop so camera more robust to pitch autopilot for rolling out to all cars please be some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by validating a driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for similar to the t is like a cross section of an electric just as the x is like a rocket trajectory our target is a reduction with as the software matures not but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by autopilot it am not looking good so should roll out this report data show that the vehicles crash rate dropped by almost percent after final report on autopilot issued by is very positive one million falcon before launch not the ideal ending there will be many improvements to over the course of the year yes it has a lot of potential in the and the end of the autopilot now downloading to all but in mode to assess if looks actuation by end of rotates degrees and does a retro burn it does liftoff all satellites deployed mission looks started deploying the iridium rocket is stable on the have you tried steam they are should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test it is early next results from limited release look good so trying our best to be super good would be a production stripped maybe as low as it will promising early results from the looks like 0 to mph in sec trend might be if the results look good from the latest point then we are days away from a release to all and to all early next week the least cool embarrassing it will in an upcoming release later this year approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine primarily vision w radar increasing capacity at existing supercharger locations now has top some are overflowing while a nearby one is longitudinal control but lateral control will cap at mph for a bit will raise after full fleet data rolls if all looks autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial new rev for autopilot rolling out to first to rest of fleet in shadow also improves and enables that was a great game via firing of falcon 9 at air force all systems are go for launch next autopilot software uploading to cars this will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next late along with kernel upgrade but held up by autopilot . it def works tho in shaving sec off if goes then upgrade goes resolving an autopilot bug that shows up when booting from a subzero if that fix software will start uploading quotes almost undergoing final might go out in next few ex on the center screen when it ends occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future grid won't be needed for moderate use superchargers in regions a mere kw what are you referring a children's brain is full right now and that's a hard one there are some installed but full really needs supercharger and plus pieces now in if you don't like the you can give it back good idea yes should complete in one is def planned for swift near my cousin's wheat farm where i had my it is keyed off the volume of music in the if you turn that down w left scroll it will be typing mars after holding down the t symbol on the center console works on s and also try renaming your car make sure your car is connected to for the will update over its cell connection but takes much to activate the model x holiday just type holidays or after pressing the looking promising for next week no major precipitating but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads some years but yes will be restored soon where there is a lead you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign night is twilight is that is actually rolling out to all model right now yes which hopefully goes out next hoping for next also going through looks like we might be ready to most of autopilot functionality for towards the end of next week receives highest owner satisfaction score of any carmaker in consumer reports survey autopilot vision neural net now working just need to get a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of in work software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and getting should start changing soon i am actually going to do this we are going to modify this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are if the site is basically no problem to it's what we do it shall be called boring traffic is driving me am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start you too you're this is becoming an supercharger spots are meant for not will take forming a rocket nozzle a life well lived how do we know this story isn't it is probably model s smashes into semi truck trailer and lifts it off the driver walks about three weeks and it will get rolled out incrementally in monthly releases yes at least some of them that doesn't make will look into about 3 weeks backlog of 5 seat 6 seat can be made actually my love the pic tho can anyone uncover who is really writing these fake can't be his work is better than perfect longer version of demo with paint it black soundtrack that and paint it black will both be uploaded for free as eggs yes with the hill option package consequences of population implosion greatly upside down demographic pyramid can't support social big mobile app update coming with next month vote tally shows of unaffiliated shareholders in favor of the thanks for sounds right all vehicles produced to as well as this is purely a software model x numbers should also improve by sec on 0 to and mile looks like the model s egg will allow it to do 0 to mph in sec and a sec mile via software update next month we won't let you we could enable although the cameras use red so it would look a little red love you a bit like but hopefully a more meaningful role for humans playing paradise in my both and i burn easily then my nose looks like the so i totally but maybe a light plaid is reserved for the next gen i like humanity there will be something special will def absorb extremely i would pay it personally if need debts must be my kids and i are having a great next software update fixes that might have an early access release ready by then now wouldn't that be interesting here is how to vote your and one day it is not actually unless we do a solar shield like a retractable hard top currently cycles radio next software release cycles between forgot to mention there will be a ludicrous egg soon that uncorks the full performance no use buttons on left side of steering wheel the only love or hate that's learned some lessons such as tweeting on isn't i personally like the 6 seat but the new 5 allows the entire back to fold a small family could camp we will probably offer that as an option exactly loving this thread primarily with boron steel b pillar has a glass excellent safety in rollover that was what took so long to in we reinforced the surrounding body structure for improved safety already 5 star in all i highly recommend the new all glass roof on the model this was very hard to but it makes the interior feel first solar roof deployments will start next summer will be on with baron in about half an hour great model x article by institutional shareholder world's top independent recommends in favor of merger congratulations to china on the successful launch of the 5 heavy lift there would def be millions of agents simultaneously doing a sim combining the results to build a map of weaknesses good chance only a matter of time before advanced is used to do internet is particularly susceptible to a gradient descent yes yes strongly net positive solar glass tiles can also incorporate heating like rear defroster on a to clear roof of snow and keep generating energy yes should mention that the solar roof is robust against any incl heavy higher insulating value than a standard pushing start to to allow more people to arrive unveil happening at because that's when solar roof plus launch event will be webcast live on at tomorrow several improvements across the board in few and in solar roof unveil now at sharp for obvious time dear cult i love you but in a slightly different way great questions this will be under not the general meant to be supplemental to the at time must be a coincidence that's real using the automated solid metal snake charger yes when you want your car to tap summon on your it will eventually find you even if you are on the other side of the country when searching for the car reads the signs to see if it is allowed to park which is why it skipped the disabled spot yes 8 and radar all flush mounted and body beauty drives itself human input at thru urban streets to highway to then finds a parking spot latest autonomous hardware allows for easy computer upgrade should mention that retrofitting to full hardware is very cost delta is more than buying a new wish it still working on the fully autonomous drive demo only completed several hours of course expects to demonstrate trip next year via true and underappreciated will post video of a navigating a complex urban environment that was what took the extra couple of this is also what i was alluding to by model 3 part 2 according to is both obvious and maybe pick one or the announcement goes live at minutes of media to calculated attempt to deceive voters about solar vote uncovered by herald does mph in seconds in the rain via this is because the first months of production are sold out moving the announcement to needs a few more days of obviously wrong not actually based on objective data shows autopilot is safer than manually driven utter empirical evidence is what not random sounds like a great good for that's why we need to accelerate solar power real fraud going on is denial of climate as for gets pennies on dollar vs how about we both go to is a via translating what actually happened in the impact velocity and center of mass of colliding object make a big difference probably not then either would also like to correct expectations that will need to raise equity or corp debt in won't be necessary for product unveiling on the by followed by on the i speed of light is a point in favor of the us automotive deaths rose to in first half of approx 1 every million miles cumulative autopilot miles now at million lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis thus i deserve to be top of the target maybe there's a dude who really digs the color gold who is slightly more and several others at various my twitter list is trimmed down to almost all these when we upgrade the core to which is probably sabotage of the rocket is but this article has some great theories it is a situation i use twitter for news my has same women as what's up with the police those are the best going out this week for x and outside north this tweet is like a test no irony or meant character is excellent and worth some of the future episodes of feature my does a great job of playing a deadly more yes will do a on mars in the next week or two corrective action seems to be limited to a small number of but thanks for letting me am tracking this down super important to be there are zero discounts even for family and something messed up policy is equal pricing for no discounts ever unless a car is a floor model or was three cable elevator on a wind force on mars is so don't need to worry about being blown a million humans could live on mars by the via good article on the interplanetary transport system on waiting for everyone to reach their seats and get starting in 5 to rocket booster spaceship m stack height full interplanetary system presentation in simulation meant to say for production vac will be up to beyond too much flow separation in earth yup yes yes pretty close is with a area ratio vacuum mars ambient will go over specs for both versions on chamber pressure is almost so engine is about the same size for a given area ratio production raptor goal is specific impulse of seconds and thrust of 3 metric at bar mach diamonds propulsion just achieved first firing of the raptor interplanetary transport engine good article on merger aiming for unveil in sf bay area of new solar roof with integrated battery and only worked if you logged on to a malicious used no customers were thanks for ordering a is sometimes criticized for government but all us car companies some got loans and only has paid its back i read a story about a father whose son died incredibly can be as little as half an hour in hot currently stops at state of this number will be preconditioning should be less dumb in the is poison all cars can't always detect babies and pets can be turned on or will allow min and max temps to be keeps temp below by automatically venting cabin turning on ac when can do this for up to a year on a full my favorite new feature is the max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from this is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to starts downloading release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small many car many definitely one of my favorite names its it is preview of the interplanetary transport system at that's a great one sounds like the right name for the rocket booster that is my favorite fictional powered by maybe ultimate version mostly because it is not the ultimate and there isn't a version i love the sounds about right turns out can go well beyond so will need a new yes won't affect performance hoping to start of on if no last minute issues put to the test by drag times glad you like i think we will probably stop at on battery turns out not forthcoming about climate change via model s loses after a will lose a will lose and an will lose comprehensive study by shows that a retains its value far better than gasoline sedans earth endangered by new strain of humans via climate change explained in comic book form by will do some press on autopilot post at and then publish at sorry about unusually difficult couple of thoughtful in space news much appreciated most likely but we can't yet find it on any vehicle sensors will get back to autopilot update blog we have not ruled that it wasn't me particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes may come from rocket or something support advice from , , others much please email any recordings of the event to important to note that this happened during a routine filling engines were not on and there was no apparent heat still working on the falcon fireball turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in it's been a little crazy lately this seems instant from a human but it really a fast not an dragon would have been finishing autopilot blog postponed to end of weekend loss of falcon vehicle today during propellant fill originated around upper stage oxygen cause still more not according to happy to do it if we need to do one more minor rev on and then will go to wide release in a few weeks writing post now with will publish on website later major improvements to autopilot coming with and software primarily through advanced processing of radar signals uh oh thanks for the longstanding faith in we very much look forward to doing this milestone flight with one of my favorite games as a kid making maybe something to announce in a few have played all prior not this one journalist for and embargo ends at product announcement at noon time today owner account of a model x severely impacted by a correlation is not causality or is to bake or not to bake cookies that is not even a definitely congrats to on her of all characters ‚Äì even those based on real people ‚Äì are entirely fictional over the entrance of true will try out this maybe reality is just a series of nested simulations all the way down would like to thank and for donating the first supercomputer to in support of democratizing technology movie still enjoyable due to some great but plot editing could've been really needed more sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots there is no product rationale for doing probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis model y off model 3 off model good point i think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after model y view of dragon from cupola we are definitely patenting this idea glad people had a great not i like those suggestions in units of hamster some good guessing by . the minibus will be built on a model x people density potential is surprisingly will be live streaming the launch party check this the libertarian argument for a carbon tax good summary of yesterday's with and me should mention that will be fully powered by clean energy when complete include battery recycling happy insurance premiums expected to decline by due to cars letter from basically every scientific org in the united states to congress about climate change via : airplane completes historic trip around the world maybe as a future would only matter if it was extremely as long as alive looking forward to the opening party on next the scale blows me away every time i see autopilot prevents serious injury or death of a pedestrian in anecdote confirmed by vehicle is driving semi doing a great job with his at he led their most successful semi truck program it's inspired by some of the custom design art great whole fallout series is both should have been done under the same corporate umbrella from the beginning master part now time post should go live on website around yup busted except for the tweet about large amounts of crack just small not easy to convey irony in a tweet finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from seems will be working at on autopilot model 3 then aiming to pull an and complete the master product plan i returning from cape to really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too heavy has enough but prob best to stay focused on the mars rocket can't wait to see all three cores of falcon heavy come back for first two will be almost landing free babel fish provided bit of a distraction working on plan out on we just completed the inspection and all systems look ready to fly falcon on at cape some in the press think they're so much smarter than owners that know makes no will be our biggest release since so taking longer to awesome on every meeting w design team every customers are v smart don't want media speaking on their behalf recent want it disabled not it can at moderate but our are very good at human anything water detection improved fan speed algorithm coming doesn't need to be so great rebuttal by a owner to those calling for autopilot to be was written with zero input from that is a very good have to focus on tonight's will post product plan want to thank both and for their help and support in making autopilot please direct all criticism at promising call today with , maker of our radar looks like significant improvements possible via software much appreciated usually we need more sane and reasonable people making their voice sensible article on autopilot by guardian on the other hand i do answer a toy phone like it's real large amounts of crack 6 hours but a lot less these days is the end of the week yes good up to our radar is using a wavelength of a good size for both decent resolution and rain am especially well logs were downloaded for and identical copies to good thing about radar is unlike is visible it can see through fog and dust yes certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving elevation too only just gained access to physical vehicle process crash would show up in logs working on using existing radar by itself from w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point like maybe didn't realize he turned it but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument exactly onboard vehicle logs show autopilot was turned off in crash would not have occurred if it was regulators find no safety concerns with autopilot it's all fun games until we don't mind taking the heat for customer it is the right thing to from can't wait to see the costume only if i can play a monkey finishes last in being i can't believe there is a real pied something like that already taken care of creating a seamlessly integrated battery solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason i like your tricky in needed for min statistical sample more software mods and data may be needed beyond blog on autopilot by us is deaths per billion is deaths per autopilot already much better than either so unless we get there and find it isn't just won't be before it is extensively tested in the lab and in the test there is no substitute for real world with less than there simply isn't enough is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient point of calling it was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't exactly that wasn't just clarification thought i was posting copied the wrong probably six will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in you're no point use of word is explicitly so that drivers don't get it is not beta software in the standard misunderstanding of what means to for any system w less than miles of real world driving today is i hope he likes what we've done in his working on top secret part hoping to publish later this story was fed to lat many other media to counter fossil subsidy both have a seriously love gets shredded won't even answer top 3 some really funny comments about model s had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by which is why thanks good point you were misleading mostly on your but w many just lost it's sense of irony didn't get my thanks the google term of would probably be more appropriate in other the intended implication is that a driver must remain just as a pilot must remain autopilot is named after aircraft as it is always expected that a pilot must stay all publicly known product developments are called incl vehicles and would be odd to response to the misleading fortune articles about autopilot sponsored articles because of course i hate try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your i love wrong to exclude autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed if you care about auto deaths as material to stock why no articles about deaths from other auto it was material to you article increased your advertising just wasn't material to as shown by radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events our condolences for the tragic loss then death do what he it is enough i may but call her my son recently asked what my favorite animal of course thoughtful analysis of the merger by thanks for the kind exactly we haven't signed anything for a factory in china journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week article is misleading to no one is in a stock for stock nothing comes off the of our love will never this is going to be great drive units and battery are sealed if curious am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on just a side limited market potential we don't recommended but model s floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of thrust via wheel owner drives through a flooded tunnel out the other side as mentioned at the beginning of the expecting success rate on landings for the is the year of looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck turns out the landing was not as fast we but still hard enough to destroy the primary and accordion the engines thanks landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the later maybe hardest impact to still upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing probably get there end of quite yes = rapid unscheduled disassembly looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing high g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at ascent phase satellites look but booster rocket had a on highly recommend anything by am concerned that advanced life may be inherently any capable of extinguishing itself eventually life you can talk to is another of many orders of magnitude less no look at and primitive life is bloody highly under the ice on hence the urgency of making life as we know it as soon as possible speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics not an i used to be one latest science predicts trillion alien either they don't last long or there are a of aliens that matches what we've found so more likely unhinged than would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none q is of greater of suspension complaints to were false location or vehicle identification numbers were used confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the model s suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter that is it was about nice comment about the model s by on no something about a flying metal yes s and x cells are also would like to clarify that is working exclusively with for model 3 news articles claiming otherwise are fourth rocket arrives in the aiming for first in of course highly recommend by the good people of if you like team fps action i love my favorite spaceship ever is in exactly good article from explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to funding how did you creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines exactly it is simulations all the way down at this really running out of crazy things to any control of super powerful by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern just heard that will ban new sales of fuel cars in what an amazingly awesome you guys baby made it chutes will be added soon interview with and via supercharger policy explained well by : will post detailed description i think it's a good good summary of annual meeting by sorry to hear will take care of this investigate to see if issues you encountered are so it was good for you too fast replay of today's rocket landing on very the crush core in the falcon legs is reusable after soft but needs to be replaced after crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping easy to replace falcon makes it back to rocket landing speed was close to design max used up contingency crush hence back forth prob but some risk of satellite deployed to km all looks 3 to launch there was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine probably not a flight but still worth really fun model x review by . best part is x racing while towing a fuel sports car flight is def capable of flying but it makes sense to apply ground delta to rocket w toughest entry great image of ancient mars no we care about doing what's fair don't always get it but intent is always there we make amends when wrong per the paid for so but it is false of news to say that took advantage of low cost we paid that is we still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care but less less of the story appears to be true news story about using labor seems to be missing a actually paid totally am told this will be fixed by maybe full height of falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ft falcon heavy side boosters can use most of the same as falcon but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer response to a mercury news article about an injury on our premises only heard about this sounds like the wrong thing happened on many will investigate and make it not there but a solution is yes yup most recent rocket took max due to v high entry will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are three's company will do another just before of the rocket in a few months dog snuggle thread on comments get really excited to announce entry into automotive it's probably the definitely full credit to the team that's doing all happening without any help from coming soon certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for the cheering is in good i think so max is just thrust and min is of 1 two outer engines shut off before the center i love you launch trajectory of commercial satellite to km above earth thank goodness all are this was a three engine landing so triple deceleration of last that's important to minimize gravity may need to increase size of rocket storage hangar rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last so odds of making it are maybe but we should learn a lot either way is increasing the production ramp as fast as but recommend ordering a model 3 soon if you want delivery yes filtering particulates from air makes a significant measurable diff to like to credit page with turning me on to defense mode is real this is what happens when you turn it have been reviewing end of line production quality slowed things down but it's for the historical mars vehicle will be next month a lot of other good exactly sides center maybe naturally falcon heavy thrust will be at liftoff twice any rocket currently it's a thrust at liftoff will be raised to later this it is capable of in payload on capabilities page figure on main should be kg no cross it would help but is not needed for these no physical changes to the this thrust increase is based on delta it is just tougher than we max performance numbers are for expendable subtract to for reusable booster basically but higher throttle good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve just posted latest max payload capabilities of falcon 9 and heavy yes turns out it doesn't need securing yes several times for sure things like this should be purged shortly for almost everything for heat shields and a few other doesn't have a deep tech understanding of i spend hours every week being educated by world's best is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast so will land on the next land landing in a few system scan detected only of orders with same email and physical those have been of course temporary spike in some areas due to x row seat should be sorted by duplicates will be max of 2 will be delivered to any one only of orders are so speculation simple answer is that there just aren't many used demand checking into it will definitely do so some places are trickier than but that's the value of having a heat shield with propulsive it could land on no but would last maybe a few tough local but wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond wouldn't be fun for longer internal volume of dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar red dragon mars mission is the first test a 3 should be but an s or particularly an x would be better that article was incredibly misleading and you should know wager right now that sun has received far more than looks like model x resale value is holding up well aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 pending detailed examination and of a returned booster we have amplified inspection to provide a stronger second layer of several parts being replaced as a by land and sea will be interesting to see what the meantime to is for these only took a owner video of autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck full play have recently come to appreciate the absurdist humor of waiting for we so often without knowing when or me great video history of falcon 9 by kinematic needs latest update activate autopilot in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell we are adding more cowbell not from but it's awesome i thought might be upset about using their material without apparently not thanks yes tickets to orbital the moon and mars will be a lot less than people just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported over the thank thanks on behalf of an amazing team at thanks for your looking forward to delivering the goods for screen cap from the stern cam of course i still love reasons for ocean landing are not orbit requires extreme horizontal getting to space needs panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire fleet nickel is also in nickels battery uses no rare earth main ingredient is which is what's used to coat so very over cars or in in first only ordered max of suggesting low levels of the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid will go all the way to will do but my speeches are just a conversation w the no time to rehearse don't want to read from a we will doesn't sound will check into we are working on enlarging the aperture will be big enough for almost most telling is that the propulsion switched from driving a turbo s to a model x model x review probably unwise won't be a but we should be able to increase the opening width and height yes yes yes yes sounds good signing off from impromptu twitter thanks for the we really will have more cow coming soon for all just an software coming this year air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height you can do that now with s and will be same for correct hopefully what's the link to but we will need to build a factory in to serve regional demand as reaches max no problem will cover whole country hopefully this year but production will be a lot faster less torque is shifted between front rear motors every traction control is way better than a normal digital vs of it will have more model 3 will be with dual motor even will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of yes superchargers and service centers will cover all of later this year definitely should be addressed this year only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof support a bike will still fit no that's not the real steering system will easily fit two child three if you buy slim some tweaking underway wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the it feels like a won't reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early edge and contour refinement are even they will be great for road trips and camping it will make sense after part 2 of the model 3 unveil a model 3 order gives you priority in your even tho total count is ordering early will make a big difference in product suggestions and criticisms are always welcome we always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a loyalty begets there will be an optional tow our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non customers to receive the matte black was surprisingly probably makes sense to bring it to if the trend before model 3 orders by end of sat model 3 design sketches we are working on an exact but will be in before 3 production they we spent a lot of time on s and x customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for they deserve a lot of _ we will send something to everyone who but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines within a can't deliver to all regions too much and a few other things token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via thought maybe people per store would line not gifts on maybe to of what no one at thought it would be this high before part 2 of the will give an update tonight for the 3 day then last one on wed for the full all efforts focused on accelerating the as of this morning now orders of course is designed to via solar panels wind using its own batteries to store electricity at def on the cards for the future should be within a week or two max hi thanks for placing your faith in i hope you have a great experience with the definitely going to need to rethink production thought it would slow way down but model 3 order count is now at recommend ordering as the wait time is growing model 3 orders at in selling price w avg option mix prob so in a future of electric cars looking will include supercharger network coming in the mail hardware in all autopilot safety features convenience features optional s and just order the option thanks for tuning in to the model 3 unveil part part 2 is super next but that's for will cover whole country yes sure is x and s will also be available adding several more countries to model 3 order page check for but will include sing model 3 whether in store or are limited to two per person online ordering at will now open at pacific to ensure no server presentation still at from almost anywhere coming incredibly inspired by the interest in model you won't be small token of appreciation coming for those who lined model 3 unveil will be webcast live at time at you will see the car very but some important elements will be added and some will tomorrow is part 1 of the model 3 part which takes things to another will be closer to model 3 order day starting in you can now buy cruise ship tickets for the arctic seeing is great article by . important to note max temp too much attention on avg max matters most looks like we may need to increase production plans for the model 3 charger map being fixed sure turn off air exits thru rear snap in shade also avail from but i just tint the rear no the meeting wasn't secret and i was only there for a few hours to talk about mars and sustainable nothing to do with congrats to many experts in the field thought was years away from achieving comp is same or better than other big diff is that we don't outsource retail sales or and rated most meaningful work in high most but that goes with the wasn't done at my good hacking is a rocket landed hard on the didn't expect this one to work hot but next flight has a good target altitude of km thanks for riding on falcon looking forward to future we spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the . has not donated to any presidential campaign evolution hasn't advanced much technology review checking exactly pushing launch to due to extreme high altitude wind hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic only heard about it doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our launch aborted on low thrust rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out scrambling to get them to great leg room for rear visibility easy storage of long it actually performed better than other colors on stain best not to have vented seats w kids can't emphasize enough that white is the best pick 6 seats unless you really need that the white interior is the highly heavy use of the white causes adding backing material to will be upgraded at no worth the wait but why piece on we are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital next gen atlas robot coming later this year there is no way it is only given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every or as high as global economy of is overwhelmingly fossil fuel so estimate of or for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude just wanted to thank g for know it meant a lot to will take good don't you already have a worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits unpaid public health costs sigh hi that's a great one too little bit worth watching for on comedy particularly the and episodes my coffee tastes unusually good this morning yes interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the that's basically what formulas this was done jointly with and radio this baby model s really is quite fun more details on model 3 unveil in coming that's it for yes no signature series for model same reservation amount for global model 3 reservations will be accepted in stores on march and online 1 good point should mention that motors itself had nothing to do with the short this was completely love this video made by my job moonlighting as a police officer in is no longer secret must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention interesting name i didn't take anyone's car and never car was actually allocated to engineering test by and inadvertently my best guess for landing success rate still a few more to then hopefully improving to in thanks falcon lands on but the lockout doesn't latch on one the four causing stage 1 would reach low earth orbit if not hefting a second but payload would be greatly didn't get environmental approval in but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is if speed at stage separation with a no need to zero out lateral so can stage at up to ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel just not physically possible to return to launch site as mentioned ship landings are needed for high velocity altitude distance don't mean much for all about steel at least the pieces were bigger this won't be last but am optimistic about upcoming ship probably that was not what prevented it being touchdown speed was but a leg lockout didn't so it tipped over after definitely harder to land on a similar to an aircraft carrier vs much smaller target that's also translating maybe some debris engine data looks will this is one of the outer conducted firing of returned falcon data looks good but engine 9 showed thrust next launch is a science mission from on aiming to launch this weekend and land on our ship landings needed for high velocity missions sad to hear that he was in summon should work anywhere connected by land not blocked by you're in la and the car is in tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage close the door and come to will do same in reverse for first baby step in summon capability now downloading with worth reading the machine an old story by falcon 9 back in the hangar at cape no damage ready to fire high res video of landing from the live video from falcon 9 standing on at cape there and back again thanks satellites deployed to target orbit and falcon has landed back at cape headed to welcome background on the launch launch landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from cape public causeway at local just reviewed mission w runs show night has a higher chance of a good punting currently looking good for a night attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at cape meant to reply to this this article does not appreciate that is in despite taxes net of rebates being incentives only a partial static fire test looks pending data will aim to launch rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing updating flight computer command sequence aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next about 2 from static fire holding for issue resolution abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle adjusting thresholds and restarting count at 5 from static fire test from to f it worked in f in this deep increases density and amplifies rocket first time anyone has gone this low for falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at cape working towards static deep liquid oxygen presenting some not really my letter authorship just agreed to add my name when they article on cars was inaccurate announcing formation of aiming for falcon rocket static fire at cape on the and launch about three days later working on wow best of luck to the launch nice looking forward to seeing you good summary of my talk in on climate change about to give a talk at the good i hope you get back into space some but credit for reusable suborbital rocket goes to and for commercial maybe unaware suborbital flight began orbital water landing orbital land landing not quite grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago is still the booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy getting to space needs but orbit requires the energy needed is the 9 units for space and for it important to clear up the difference between and as described well by congrats to and the team for achieving on their booster sounds you had me at yeah and hell yeah from anywhere should mention that i will be interviewing people personally and autopilot reports directly to this is a super high we are looking for hardcore software no prior experience with cars please include code sample or link to your ramping up the autopilot software team at to achieve generalized full if contact definitely current production is can be upgraded by well noted that's model s ludicrous mode achieves sec mph and sec mile in motor trend test comes with each car compliment from is much but the people of deserve all the credit i should clarify that is an independent we don't have any control over the mid to late next we are being more cautious expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each given high local a in would probably make sense in the long establishing charging and service infrastructure in official launch in next several auto import duties are prohibitively hoping for a special category for most of our discussion was about we just finished building a huge expansion in these are all things said before and are naturally needed to improve so no real news model 3 is due in a china factory for local demand be as soon as a year a factory in happen for same my comments in china weren't transcribed will keep making cars batteries in ca as far into future as i can important to set ac to not exits thru and use the snap in which service can provide amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord would cost less and work better with a new autopilot coming curve speed controller better lane holding on poor improved fleet regulatory approvals so autopilot rolling out to all which is still under all hoping for release good will write up a list of software priorities in the coming what and functionality improvements would you like to see in the or new features already in rest of states in region next thanks planning to have a big opening in city soon and then proceed gradually to central and south me always happy to make others happy big update coming in we won't but yes gets top rating of any company in most says of owners expect their next car to be a acid consumer reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production already addressed in new already there congrats on driving a from la to in just over two autopilot release to and pending regulatory hopefully get the in the next few watched the whole one of the best shows i like your work too sure actually works best at night review of model s by depends on regulatory but hopefully end of next week million miles per day lots of upgrades and a new although main upgrade coming with roughly 5 days same will have a new interface more comprehensive update coming with yes some exciting news this version 7 software with autopilot goes to wide release on rapidly decays back to is absorbed by what matters is adding new carbon to surface cycle from underground gas intentions are but massively effect on in beats hp from 0 to in dutch magazine test i didn't walk back apart from media hype yo regarding the his team created a beautiful but the functionality isn't compelling by version it will i don't hate it's a great company with a lot of talented i love their products and glad they're doing an peak temp increases due to climate change mostly accurate and fun movie about worth you can mount a rack to the roof via suction cups and still have one falcon door work guaranteed up to door is larger than opening and acts as an upper interior trim has hydrophobic front doors have a short arc and their interior panels are back model x defense mode definitely filters viruses even the small has hospital operating room level am def on how falcon doors work in tight above 6 my height doors work side view of falcon wing doors that's a great i think we can do price of model x is actually only more than lower cost versions coming time model x launch webcast live today at time to show the real great discussion about empowering rural communities dinner in an old best menu art it was super good midnight dinner in in expendable falcon heavy can send a fully loaded dragon to mars or a light dragon to mission be dragon 2 is designed to land on any surface or in the solar am glad to see people thinking about researchers at propose using for mars sample return mission new model for evolution of intelligent life suggests probable emergence 2 billion years ago near galactic center not saying we nuke mars just out a few options first production cars will be handed over on at our factory definitely lithium deal is not exclusive has many the press on this matter is unveil in start model our smaller and lower cost sedan will start production in about 2 fully operational with same model x is more than an s due to greater size body series is fully hence high i appreciate the kind words in the judging by the picture it looks your bill was very but achieving a long range affordable electric vehicle has always been our due in late article on and colonizing mars by comments section on this article is awesome provided all ten take you have does seem kinda wrong yes the car will learn over but there is a min caliber of starting various forms of shades are being may not be necessary all regions final corner case is dealing with low contrast lane markings white on while driving into the sun at dusk almost ready to release highway and parallel software update thanks thanks even if we should at least attempt to postpone the advent of sooner isn't if you‚Äôre against a military arms please sign this open probably end of year ludicrous rear drive and battery pack model s product call at rocket discussion at noon on expect to reach preliminary conclusions regarding last flight by end of will brief key customers then post on our cause still unknown after several thousand of now parsing data with a hex editor to recover final thanks not the best birthday that's all we can say with confidence right will have more to say following a thorough fault tree there was an event in the upper stage liquid oxygen data suggests thanks falcon 9 experienced a problem shortly before first stage will provide more info as soon as we review the drone takes pic of drone ship on station in the course i still love just before it left port trying for another rocket landing this time on the course i still love you're good end of year credit for is really due to rive bros great team my contribution is fairly via important to note that model s resale value is also higher than that of gasoline cars service team helps save a stray kitten that took refuge in a model nice work to be is supporting a student design competition for not trying to build other cos are doing will also do a reference pod to be shown after the bonus for all racing teams that exceed my kids love lost by . now on a rare second thanks for letting us this is helpful for figuring out fairing air force certifies to compete for launching national security satellites what are the best riddles you've heard that are short enough for another good drill a hole thru a sphere such that the height of what remains of the sphere is what is its remaining astronomer royal martin how soon will robots take over the - via this is not the full it is just the pilot plant fossil fuels by a says hi thanks that is if someone says they are thinking about having i always encourage them to do it is total hurtful to claim that i told a guy to miss his child's birth just to attend a company i would never do of quotes from 2 need i strongly support pregnancy leave never called myself a samurai i have never written or said book was not independently should be taken w a grain of max acceleration was altitude lateral distance and velocity main chutes deployed dragon abort test video dragon abort test 0 to mph in top speed of mph hold down firing of dragon 2 spacecraft at cape very funny post of a owner test driving a gasoline car while i like the take the with a grain o salt per article my favorite shot from the last rocket landing attempt on the last night's and unveiling press conference went way over tried to give all the journalists who'd traveled far an opportunity to ask a for more info on check out press for utility scale is the real kicker awesome for the future to be we need electric solar power and rocket launch satellite in transfer still so damn looking fwd to it feeling normal one worth watching . the would be in the not the but otherwise new roadster battery should complete safety validation by end of so likely available in august while the rocket does look rather tall a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve next attempt in 2 i only invest in companies i help found or to help a friend or a cause return expected for latter is no hull breach and repairs are impact is closer to a fast fire than an high color slow motion rocket landing video if this treating myself to a volcano it's looks like we got some killer footage from the chase big small posting shortly looks like falcon landed but excess lateral velocity caused it to tip over post landing ascent dragon to space rocket landed on but too hard for 3 to liftoff launch window always tight when orbital in this space for gravity null moon was in the launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than the figure by end of year is only many launches have asked if we can do something philanthropic with the ca aqueducts to help the water we debated but there really is gas saved by most owners over 5 yrs ownership since it's we are sticking w waited to say something until after we fixed some of the options pricing and colors many just announced new mile range car for gas savings to land a just read the instructions testing of the high performance version of the model s by battery need to state power energy density the same plus how long they they usually fail on welcome to . he will apply formula 1 techniques to revolutionize servicing mainstream you had me at sheen or must admit to liking fault in our romantic and beautifully named we just got banned in west oh announcing the amazing model w with all that solar power being it almost feels like something is needed to complete the picture just hit a new daily energy record of two weeks after reaching major new product line not a car will be unveiled at our design studio on right move is try both tunnels and flying having streets and buildings means bad traffic reasons i like you still travel in but immune to quiet and no risk cars fall on your head flying car travel in risk of car falling on head much grounded in bad weather contrary to press not against flying just said it was important to consider both pros and maybe it's but i really want to see mammoths falcon 9 lifting off with pounds of force reading look to windward by he is an amazing pantheon books largely illustrate why the three laws don't work another egg will be hidden in the model s code in last one took a year to next one should be just changed them to full public domain photos are now available under a creative commons license thanks to everyone that supported in new we couldn't have done it without when cars become safer than the public may outlaw the hopefully to be is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will that is battery pack swap is active between sf and la and seems to be working supercharging is the for neither i nor the company are selling even if we i wouldn't do it would be our long term results are what some people seem to think i tweet to affect share this is a brief rise in stock obviously does no good for or systems generated a new daily record of 4 this week world's largest hedge fund soon to be powered by artificial intelligence maybe this is all the work of the certainly connects a lot of themes for more on the and the ancient were but if aliens built the they would've left behind a computer or something the rumor that building a spaceship to get back to my home planet mars is totally untrue please don't mention the stacking stone blocks is not evidence of an advanced seems like an opportune moment to bring up the aka are the really odd that we see no sign of model s in drag race against snowmobile on ice lake in tire chains or there is no slowdown of the construction as anyone near with eyes can it's not some shots of the pilot plant of full under construction upgrades in the works to allow landing for thrust deep upper stage tank vol both satellites deployed on now firing their ion to reach station over next landing attempt will be launch from tonight's flight and following one will not have enough excellent and funny intro article about artificial highly recommend reading model s rated by as best car in world for year in a row landing on a stormy sea rocket soft landed in the ocean within of target nicely high probability of good landing in primary mission on spacecraft head towards the all good we could actually do we should planning a significant upgrade of the for future missions to handle literally maybe give it a for good measure can't delay any must proceed with primary mission to launch the deep space climate observatory mega storm preventing from remaining on so rocket will try to land on survival probability coming home dragon splashdown off the coast launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the but dragon still inbound from orbit in extreme wind shear over cape feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the hoping it changes are the civilian prob good will give us time to replace stage video transmitter needed for but nice to air force tracking radar went launch postponed to same time rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space almost force and plenty of hydraulic fluid launching our deep space mission headed to gravity null point at further than if you are curious about the you can schedule a test drive painting the name on the acceleration will also but not quite as much video made by owner of a going up a grade on snow passing a whole bunch of stuck dual motor cars are also main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on insane speed was a side effect 0 to acceleration will improve by sec soon via software update to inverter algorithm great video of people experiencing acceleration for the first time final anything launched by a you could ever reach ~ mach would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere ion are but have extremely tiny force even must have more thrust than weight or you don't go and don't ask me about space elevators until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge reason is newton's third in there is nothing to you must react against ejected if u saw and wonder why doesn't use an electric rocket to reach it is that is impossible west coast under construction will be named course i still love good primer on the exponential advancement of particularly good piece in honor of repairs almost done on the spaceport drone ship and have given it the name read the the universe is really big of next rocket landing on drone ship in 2 to 3 weeks w way more hydraulic at least it explode for a diff full unscheduled ship is fine minor exciting residual fuel and oxygen combine rocket hits hard at deg smashing legs and engine section before fins lose power and go engines fights to but turns out we recovered some impact video frames from drone it's kinda begging to be contact at also thinking of having an annual student pod racer like formula will be building a test track for companies and student teams to test out their most likely in funding research on artificial intelligence it's all fun games until someone loses an i yesterday's mission to the space station lights up the cloudy night sky of cape world's top artificial intelligence developers sign open letter calling for safety hydraulics are usually but that adds mass vs short acting open fins only work for 4 we were am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards on this you guys upcoming flight already has more hydraulic so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next grid fins worked extremely well from velocity to but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before didn't get good pitch dark and will piece it together from telemetry and actual ship itself is some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be rocket made it to drone spaceport but landed but no cigar this bodes well for the future ascent phase dragon deployed to space station rendezvous launching in one minute at mission control in launch in looks good so swimming on the moon need to investigate the upper stage z was behaving next launch attempt on at taking questions now at background on our attempt to land falcon 9 rocket on a drone ship in the drone spaceport ship heads to its hold position in the to prepare for a rocket landing ask me anything at time on tomorrow's rocket we are actually working on a

welcome back to run the communications that works for but hard to do for something long like falcon the flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we but no entry velocity too high for a precision landing with must have surfaces for pitch using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign more maybe flight grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for style each fin moves independently for base is ft by with wings that extend width to will allow refuel rocket in testing operation of grid fins going on next flight cuteness overload mt a baby baboon snuggled with a teddy bear about the deal with really hate it when companies bring out an awesome show car and then you can never actually buy so rumors about canceling falcon wing doors

excellent explanation of the diff getting to orbit vs space by ) handing over the first model s cars in japan it was exactly what i was looking for long exposure of 6 transiting to orbit over china noodles in launch in hours if weather lightning tower struck but no effect on rocket or satellite the graph that really matters expansion to already map is being all of by end of model s limits torque if brake going to zero torque with brake press would be a safety i we are fixing this updated map coming that has been my goal from the need the for model ad taken out in alto daily by two model s owners is many of the suggestions will be implemented three engine vehicle during test no injuries or near rockets are tricky technically model 3 or maybe three horizontal won't be three vertical am a

the upper stage if all goes restart to raise apogee live video feed of launch at about an hour away from like to thank for taking a chance on . we've given it our cool i will be restored it was fixed this so he should try the test the writer of this article had a problem with his so main pack was constantly charging doesn't sound if it we certainly need to fix govt reviews model s all due to high speed no no no recall all known rocket anomalies will spend another day rechecking to be launch attempt eve w wed as the gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the which produces horsepower weighs lbs engines are cycling cleanly w ground replaced gas generator on engine 9 as a precautionary abort was caused by oxygen in ground side upper stage on separate internal so doesn't face same rocket engines are but cleaning gas generators will take another aiming for eve will probably at least a few depends on whether we need to pull the we called manual better to be paranoid and bringing rocket down to engines if launch we will bring the rocket down for engine so probably a few days before next attempt increasing helium spin start probably chance of passing all but worth a countdown resuming launch aborted by due to slower than expected thrust seems on closer cycling live stream of launch at to liftoff almost all is being reserved for satellite to give max chance of

sudden you can fit a lot of kindergartners in a model s - chronicle am thinking of doing a movie of sorts to thank you for that was bad for this for the planet worth reading merchants of same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change climate change should really be considered a centrist as it affects am not suggesting shutting down but rather to price in environmental cost shift to sustainable energy even if the answer is only on the order of we should still take immediate as there is only one right question to ask or what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate what most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about that is not the very scientific consensus at time of was world was round sorry for all the heavy stuff climate but i really thought world take action no time for subtlety exactly in of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change climate change deniers claim same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades good article on vs referred by was beat up pretty badly as a kid left me w jagged harder to breathe as i got so time to had a minor so am in bed in probably shouldn't be tweeting sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside we really need to promote that fact in the a tax will not cause economy to grind to a would love to do a pickup something w ultra low cg for sports car dynamic air suspension mega i from w zero govt then put of that into if consumption is then the tax is proportionately we should prob not have tax on basic foods critical carbon produced by a rocket flight is roughly equal to one we should not be net of gas a is to with down payment taken care of by tax maybe less costly then it first am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad market will then achieve best trees are net consumers of so technically we would pay them money seems crazy to risk the chemical experiment when we have to find another solution big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases much better to emphasize the the collective wisdom of the market is usually better than the smartest govt me other private money funded for first 7 got govt money for now paid carbon tax would be a better _ there should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten just like we do a weight of scientific taxes don't ban a they just increase am against except in extreme better to tax known bad thing and desired instead of subsidizing particular solution let market i am in favor of simple taxes that are neutral on most good great article on battle by who lives in _ belief in climate change isn't even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon making rockets don't like having a zillion tweets in the makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet we created electric cars to help solve the not because we thought it was easy still since we will run out of oil why risk the future of all life on earth simply to delay sustainable those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong more failed to pay back apart those 2 you were totally as many have already is a division of an we specifically said first interview with about and doe loan gets into some of the details wired the funds to repay the doe loan only us car company to have fully repaid govt physics a big fan of was going to do my at on but we need a breakthrough in energy high pressure helium pneumatic bolts and no will get one plus another chicken you're it did seem like the chicken of destiny xx petting zoo left a chicken behind at the now we have a pet soon model s will feature dancing around a miniature stone you by making it go to that makes it louder than loud supercharger announcement pushed to next something else this physics + a broad range of worth taking humanities courses particularly usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the model s we do harder than but it is a software vs hardware change vast majority of credit for should go to peter rive their awesome just a small over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering other improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term not sales it can do hands free right being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to mostly water or coffee at when will have neat or vodka with it can dig up almost we don't do a good job of telling people about this requires hardware given the extreme shorts are pushing every possible uncertainty doubt story software knits together google others and streams over be people tell me is a shill for the don't know if but he sure behaves that would also recommend the cheese spam or fish license by hold down voice button say paradise by weird model s can play almost any song via don't forget the mystery part 5 of the there is a way for the model s to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas totally will circle back and do something cool for roadsters next stay tuned just want to say thanks to customers investors that took a chance on through the dark we wouldn't be here without thanks am a fan of google in but cars comments to were just no big announcement here priority is electrification of so priority is model model then mass market third gen vehicle truck exactly creating an autopilot for cars at is an but not yet top still a few years from tested it myself this weekend and was working some songs have licensing prohibiting direct anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at please from martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at it is super moon is basically in our back yard relative to definitely a lot of potential for but depends on well too expensive in most that probably makes most people have never heard of that will hopefully change over that has been the goal from the beginning it can definitely strain but i loved doing my first company with my brother earnings call next then supercharger week after and the mystery you're welcome we need a compelling video that convinces lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other why isn't that _ is took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering who fully understood the am getting lots of questions about the big supercharger aiming to do that the week after this does put an indirect floor on resale should help all raises model s resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry side boosters fall short center core goes too far + is heavily landing permission tricky we can't formally provide a guarantee restating but i feel confident about the value that is super will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean your article many rightly identified that we made a new financing is not but much the legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in so rotate about degrees to deploy more likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of doesn't understand we did a ton of testing until they could handle legally required impact extremely high pressure needs to be ultra all 4 legs together ft weigh less than model shows a little design is a telescoping piston w a this is about getting a prior announcement not part 4 time to up the ante fix some announcement we're aiming for late but needs to have overlapping capability to be would do the same role is launch site don't think she has anything against media just not her cool just read good maybe a v long

sterling makes the case for direct sales in congrats to and on supersonic test first test of the falcon ignition not long now before the hold down fire am for good public transit in but the pace of that construction makes the look this argument is a bit a city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn't thanks for buying our important announcements are always about making product experience market follows announcement of new strategy owners will like just read and seems to be some stormy weather over in these days comm overruled good recommendation of hearing please contact commissioner and this is not good for the people of not all good commissioner just denied a dealer despite hearing officer being in we have great try wringing water out of a towel in zero g is way via evolving yes good grasshopper rocket flies up holds against wind and taken from our will post a video of the latest grasshopper flight tomorrow from the camera on our new now with actual picture cool picture of crossing sent to me by . would be amazing to visit in person one congratulations to ! orbital's rocket makes successful test flight we have a lot of heavy lifting will ask my team to send it heart goes out to people of central home of all resources at disposal to help in any a petition to allow direct sales of cars by please vote here if you live in and are pro please vote in the opinion unveils drive for space supremacy via stay tuned for a big supercharger announcement in a few definitely have you hearing from constituents is super important to counteract the influence of the dealer new judge dealers cannot utilize the franchised dealer act as a means to sue their new judge just ruled in favor dismissing the legal attack by auto dealers to prevent direct for should motors be able to sell directly to you're right just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in will hang around after press to thank people in already partly here with rocket but will make it a lot bigger with the launch site just had for lunch in capitol about to head to house committee hearing to advocate for in in to make the case for allowing to sell come to capitol room at which leads me to my next subject of gun control just kidding no more political comments for me now that shot off both my when a person the right thing to do is remember the good more than the not a day for hate there is ever at the risk of losing more i like i also like good people on both am not trying to accumulate cool she was far from but her on were her later years are but her early years are not went from dreary to great always admired thatcher she was but sensible much like my we went through literally hundreds of variants of red trying to find something original that didn't do all the intro courses for and then specialize in the one you like new red going down assembly line for the first we spent a lot of time on this calls a am deeply model s warranty does cover exactly great explanation of the announcement by hoping to open the century city store this it is my neighborhood so there all the we are working hard to make that should be late for us and early for am headed to next week to thank people personally for supporting please head to @ tomorrow certainly true that many people believe that and are powered by the infinite improbability drive today's announcement is actually the in a 5 part trilogy you never know thanks beauty of over the air software updates is that the product keeps improving even after you buy thanks good seeing you in awesome job with to be

battery company renames itself after bankruptcy recovery ship has secured powering down all secondary cargo looks a telemetry says main parachutes deployed now visually confirmed recovery ship just heard the sonic booms from dragon reentry and has data transmission dragon burn was all on target for future will indeed be rooftop solar + battery w utility company just providing backup power slight change of date to ensure no end of quarter distractions will be next really exciting announcement coming on am going to put my money where my mouth is in v major there's there's then there's north it will be slightly smaller w fewer features as think or 3 vs model s being or yep sure . model s works great in highest are in and we have a ton of customers in but when considering savings of gas v true cost vs gas cars is more like for a v sweet ride . in $ + w mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about . it has always been my dream to produce a low compelling electric we are 3 to 4 years wish it could be was this in a test drive car are all about to be or a current customer review of model s by . good article w minor errors addressed in reader comments when comet hit in it made an earth size we be super dead if it actually hit earth probably true rock a my talk at ted with plum brook space power facility research help from the team much testing separation of rocket

forward to giving that a random my grandfather great grandfather were both born in i was named after my auto dealers tried to pass legislation to block bill was just defeated in thanks is expanding launch ops at need 2 locations to handle flight rate and avoid weather risk arrived talking with house about creating an orbital launch complex near then keynote pretty couldn't leave the country of without doing something saw a play about in like watching mimes with emoticons doing am in to thank the customers of highest model s orders per in the just received docking clearance from . will begin orbital maneuvers to space station at pacific would also like to thank for allowing us to use their long range comm system for dragon in free just want to say thanks to for being the world's coolest looking forward to delivering the orbit raising burn dragon back on pods one through four are now operating preparing to raise all systems pods 1 and 4 now online and dragon transitioned from free

all good on the t minus to launch mission 3 to dock with the space station computer glitch found by avionics while bench testing on couldn't replicate on launch launch on track for tomorrow morning at am cape time then no need for clean energy as is priced into behavior a carbon tax would affect coal even more than so electricity would also become more expensive one often hears that there is no point in a us carbon tax unless china they just did rocket static fire cape launch pad looks engines generated tons of parameters best is winning competitions like formula or other evidence of exceptional ability thought you might appreciate that flight of dragon spacecraft carried a large wheel of cheese thanks ! the model s delivered what a ride to make you going appreciate thoughtful faith in revolutions don't happen if you just roll over to the powers that got to fight for what you that's why genius move to be they did use the controversial gimmick of actually charging up the about halfway through east coast supercharger test drive of model s w testing the model s on a surface of pure ice and snow more free east coast superchargers coming will allow lower initial v high speed trip long like top gear pretended the roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it logs showed miles range thanks support of real customers like yourself who drive the car every day is v much data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from but after top gear we always keep it on for blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on also lining up other journalists to do same article about range in cold is vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max took a long busted just going to say i collect antique next grasshopper rocket

corresponding w chief esquire article had high fiction maybe already under but are happy to help with the lithium ion what it feels like to ride a rocket to be super i don't wish to could mandate anything about a mars am just working on the tech to get people i am not the kale eating overlord of mars kale has its nice story about a model s coast to coast road by end of it will be superchargers all the this gives a sense of what mars would look like after changing the climate to sustain life death valley restored to position of world's hottest place death valley is hot weather testing was done model s was fine but gas tow truck interesting i will read v merry cowboy riding the rocket no single camera view of the meter rocket hover then we took him for a meter hover flight of the grasshopper test rocket to provide a little perspective on the size of we added a 6 ft cowboy to the rocket very much agree with this great review of chasing ice on have driven a model s miles it's clearly the of far the best car ever a beautiful and view of earth from the international space station good piece on volcanoes the would seem to roughly equivalent to a flight from la to that's why a believer in solar we have a giant fusion reactor conveniently located in the exactly mt " continuing the uncontrolled experiment of adding to atmosphere is a bad it is hard to argue with a global

report that was narrowly cash flow positive last continued improvement expected through year uranium ore now available on so much more convenient than thanks can't put my finger on but for some reason the newsstand is looking particularly good right now but if humanity wishes to become a then we must figure out how to move millions of people to i do in fact know that this sounds that is not lost on
